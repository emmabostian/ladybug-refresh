Emma  1:33  
turn the page and talk about you know,

Kelly  1:36  
well thank you for volunteering to go first.

Emma  1:41  
So I actually have quite a bit of experience self publishing ebooks. We will talk a little bit about self published versus publisher, ebooks or books in general. But I only have experience with self published ebooks. I wrote my first one I would say around April or May of last year, it was called decoding the technical interview process. And to be honest, okay, I don't want this to sound conceited. But I do feel like me publishing my book and my financials, like spurred this massive influx or outflow of people creating their own ebooks. And I love it. Yeah, I feel like ebooks now. Yeah, because I think mine was one of the first that I had seen. I'm not saying it didn't exist. But mine was one of the first that I had seen from a developer, publishing their own ebook, and then, like publishing their financials along with that. Yeah. So that was my first one. I also did a second one. On blogging, it was like the beginner's guide to blogging. And I have published both of those myself and made an absorbent amount of money. We can talk more about that. Later, I'm going to link my blog post in the in the show notes, I basically, I made $40,000 off of my first ebook that was priced at $10. And if you want to learn more about the financial so that you can go check it out. And that is my experience, what am

Ali  2:58  
I Oh, my experience is a little bit different. I wrote a free ebook. And this was before most people were like, on the E book bandwagon, it was,

Unknown Speaker  3:09  
I think,

Ali  3:10  
last fall, maybe fall 20. I don't know, years or hard. I'm really bad at math. It was a while ago, it was pretty random and very much pre pandemic. And so my thing behind that was that I wanted it to be free. So I did not make any money off of it. And the idea behind it was first that it would be good for the community and build my audience. The second thing behind it would be that it built my email list. So people had to give their email in order to get the book in return. and that in turn, made it so that I felt like an 11,000 person email list. It reached number four on Product Hunt for the day, a lot of people have read it and emailed about it and enjoyed it. So I think it was worth doing but definitely very different than your both which have been more in order to make money off of which is probably the way to go. But we can talk about the decision making and why I did not monetize mine. Then the other thing that I will talk about during this episode, this is behind the scenes is still in a very, very early process. And so I don't want to give any details whatsoever. But I'm actually currently working with a publisher on a book too. So we'll talk about all those decisions throughout this episode. Kelly, how about you?

Kelly  4:22  
So first off, I do want to mention that I really want to dig into pricing and monetization later because actually offering free ebooks in my space like an e commerce space is super popular. So it is a really great lead gen tactic in terms of my book, so I published a book in June last year called start freelancing today and Emma very much told me to write a book. And so I did. I think I did you asked me you

Emma  4:55  
were like, would you be offended if I also publish an E book? I'm like, Why the heck

Kelly  4:58  
would I be you're like, please do it. Exactly, yeah, yeah, so I decided to announce that I was writing an E book on freelancing in May, and I gave myself a month to write and edit and launch it, which was kind of rushed. But I managed to get through it. And I have, again, we can talk about pricing and stuff a little bit later. But I've, I've kind of sold my book at various price points. I also have an audio book version of mine, and I sell a bundle of the E book and the audio book. So a bunch of things that we can kind of dig into there, I have made a little over 31,000, to date for that book. And I'm actually looking at printing a physical copy of the book, that

Ali  5:39  
would be so fun.

Emma  5:40  
Yeah, that's awesome. I'm kind of jealous.

Kelly  5:43  
I think that it'll be fun for us to discuss. And it's not too late for you to print your book, I, I've been talking to other people who have printed who have gone through the book printing process, because again, you can I did, I self published mine. And you can also print your own copies of books, my whole thing is that I just don't want to deal with shipping, the book that's so

Ali  6:01  
big, becoming a distributor for anything.

Kelly  6:05  
Is sucks. Let's just put it that way. I do not envy companies who ship their own products. That's a lot of work. Okay, so let's actually dig into a little deeper self publishing versus going through a publisher. And I do not have any kind of experience working with a publisher, I would love to work with a publisher. At some point, I don't know what I would write, you know, if somebody wants to, like, you know, get my Memorial or something, I hit me up, I'm totally open to doing that. Maybe in like five years, I have something to talk about that.

Emma  6:38  
I've been an ally can probably attest to this, I i've been contacted by several companies to write a book with them. And my biggest deterrent was like the opportunity cost, there just was not something that favored what I was looking to do at the time. So I, my personal opinion is like it's a great career move, it's great to put on your resume, but you're not necessarily going to get rich off of the royalties, depending on whether or not you have your own audience. So and this is going to be the same for like courses and you know, other content as well. If you work with a large company or a well known brand, that's a great resume move. And it helps you build your audience, but in my experience, the royalty percentages and like whether or not they give you an advance or a bonus or whatever, is not

Ali  7:28  
going to yank you so let's talk about that. First off the advanced, the advanced, some publishers give you before you actually write the book. And it's kind of like a stipend. So that I think in theory, you can live off of that stipend, though I'm not sure that many people actually make a big enough stipend to actually live off of, but I think that's the idea behind it. So you actually have a payment upfront. And then that money is taken away from the royalties when the book is released. And so the royalty is a percentage of the book selling that you actually make that income. So I very much 100% agree, if I were writing a book, to make a lot of money off of I would self publish, I would do an E book by myself, I would use a payment platform and do all that. But that being said, I have decided right now in my career, my biggest thing that I want to work on is establishing my credibility because I think that I don't know, I get so worked up over the internet, sometimes people like acting like I'm some beginner, like, who doesn't know what I'm talking about. And the tweets that I always get about that it drives me up the frickin wall. And so for me, I mean, it's like a self thing, like being able to work with a publisher and have them give me that legitimacy, I guess and have it reviewed and all that that's, that's exciting to me. The other piece behind it is I really like the accountability that somebody else's like there to make sure that you're actually writing things or proofreading it, they're handling the business side of everything. So that's really nice. And that's why I've decided to go down that road. That being said, I will definitely do an E book that costs money at some point. It's just I have to prioritize right now. And I think, again, the E book is the best way to make money off of it. But if your goal is something different, like legitimacy, then maybe going with a publisher who has a big name could be the way to go.

Emma  9:20  
Yeah, and I think it's really easy to look at what I have done, what Kelly has done, what Florin pop has and what other I hate this word but like tech influencers people with felt like several 1000 followers on Twitter, who have an audience to market to it's easy to look at how much money we've made off of our books, and think that it's going to be a get rich quick scheme for you. Just be aware that like a we already had audiences to market to be it also depends on the type of content that you're producing. So if there is a high demand for the type of E book you want to write, you're going to sell more. But yeah, and we'll talk about pricing later. It also depends on how you're pricing this whether or not you have different tiers to purchase Just from like, when I did my blogging book, I had a basic tier that was like, I think it was priced at, like maybe $15. And then the advanced or the top tier had all of my financial data from all of my blogs to date for an additional $10. And so the way that you price these things is gonna play into that. But yeah, just be conscientious that, wow, there's very little to no startup cost to publish your own ebook. The, the amount of income you make is going to vary depending upon brochure and the amount

Ali  10:28  
of work involved is going to also be super variable to depending on who you want to get it in front of, and what is that all going to look like? Like, you may, if you have a smaller audience want to buy something like Facebook ads or Twitter ads for your product. And so that's a cost right there. And then you normally have to pay your payment processor as well. It's usually like a percentage, and we'll talk about that. And then I'm paying for getting the the physical copy, if you have like an editor or something like that, you have to pay for that. So there are costs that go into this, you could do it for free, you can do it for completely free. But usually it's going to end up costing more, or it's gonna end up costing you something to publish the book.

Kelly  11:20  
Yeah, it all depends on the tools you end up using. And speaking of tools, let's jump into software that you can use to create an E book. I think we all used different tools different

Emma  11:34  
Yeah. Yeah. So when I did mine, I use the Mac pages application, which is a native app that comes on your Mac computer. And the interface was decently intuitive to use, I had some issues with it. But that being said, the exporting options, there was a lot of formatting issues with EPUB. And mobi, maybe I don't know how to say it. But those two formats, like the formatting was just an absolute disaster. So the PDF version was like the only one that stayed in place. So I will not be using the pages app again. Canva is a really great option that I've used in the past, but I wouldn't recommend it for like 200 Plus page ebooks, like I think it's good if you're publishing like a 15 to 20 page ebook, those are great. And you can even use Canva to make other graphics for ebooks and whatnot. But yeah, I wouldn't necessarily recommend that one for large ones. And then the other two that I've worked with, well, first of all, the way that I write it is I write all of my copy in Google Docs. I think that's the easiest way to do it, right? you're copying Google Docs, and use like the Table of Contents feature and everything works great. And then migrated into a platform. caliber is an app I've used. It's not pretty, I'll tell you that right now. But it is actually a way to keep track of all the ebooks that you're publishing. But my biggest recommendation, if you have the time, is to use MDX with next js. I'm working with the egghead IO team. There's a separate team that works on building courses, like Kent does testing react, and they were working with Dan Abramov on, I don't know some react course, to working with me on my technical interview course. And they've built out an entire app that allows us to write it and allows me to write in MDX and just run like a PDF command, and it'll generate a brand new PDF with all the graphics and everything using next j. s. And it's absolutely awesome. But yeah, that's a kind of time consuming. Oh,

Ali  13:36  
that sounds so nice, though, the fact that you get to read it in markdown, because that's how I personally write blog posts. But I did the same actually, or similar for my my ebooks. So I started off writing all the copy in Google Docs. And then I moved it out to sketch the design software, which is the worst thing that I could have done, I would not recommend that to my worst enemy. It's impossible to edit it. They updated their software and it made it so that like my ebook is unformatted and so I need to go back from scratch if I ever want to edit it. Like people have been like, there's a typo on page three, and I'm like, great. That would take me like 20 hours of work to fix so I'm just not going to it's a free ebook. You can deal it's a nice Yeah, exactly. Um, so I would not recommend that to anybody I would not do that do not use I mean, maybe there's plugins or something. Maybe I just did it the wrong way. But sketch for me was not a great thing to use, but I did use club rave to or caliber, as Emma pronounce it, I'm not sure what it is.

Kelly  14:36  
I think it's, I always look called over Okay, I called it clay. So

Ali  14:39  
it's probably caliber. Um, so that is really helpful for actually exporting to ebook formats. Because I originally did PDF, which I think was fine, but people really want like the other ebook formats like I don't even know what they are.

Unknown Speaker  14:58  
Like e pub. I

Unknown Speaker  14:58  
think

Ali  14:59  
my Yeah, so yeah, I had to use calibrate or caliber to convert it.

Emma  15:06  
You know what other like speaking of design tools because sketch is for prototyping, but yeah, to your point at first I was like maybe I should use sketch. Adobe InDesign is a tool that you can use to publish and design ebook not published. But to design ebooks. It's similar in nature to sketch where it is a design application, it's a little tricky to use. And there are websites that interface with InDesign, I don't remember what they're what they're called. One more thing I wanted to mention was book right. I haven't personally used it, but I have checked it out online. It looks really promising. I don't think you need to know Adobe InDesign, because that was one of the barriers to entry for me looking at new applications. But if you try it, and you like it, let us know. Cool.

Kelly  15:49  
So I wrote my book starting, I started on Google Docs. And then I actually moved over to Microsoft Word for writing the book initially. And the reason why I did this is because I wanted to use their dictate. So I can just talk about the book and then go back and have my editor actually go through and make it make sense. I think I feel like this sped up the writing process for me significantly. I did end up moving it over two pages at like I just exported the doc file and imported it into pages for a little bit extra formatting for the PDF version. I don't remember what I did for I must have I think I went from just like Word to import get to caliber to export it for the proper EPUB mobi files. And then I also had to import it. I also sell my book on Amazon for kindle, and that was a whole separate process as well. But I'm, I pretty much wrote like 90% of my book and edited it in Microsoft Word.

Ali  16:52  
That's a good tip.

Emma  16:53  
You should definitely publish a post about like how you publish for kindle, because I would actually be interested in that.

Kelly  16:59  
Okay. Yeah, I could totally do that. It was an adventure text to speech is a really good, or the speech to text.

Ali  17:07  
I got that the wrong way around is a really good tip as well,

Kelly  17:10  
though. Yeah. I mean, you have to speak clearly. But the fact that I do so many podcasts has helped with my, my dictation and cadence to actually have, you know, Microsoft Word pick up what I'm actually trying to say. For the most part, though, for the most part, I sometimes don't like slips in some real weird things that I like most definitely didn't say, but technically is correct, like grammatically. So it didn't show up with like little red squiggly. And then my editor is going through and reading this. She was like, Okay, this is definitely not what you wanted to say here. This is extremely offensive, but

Emma  17:48  
and you're like, No, no, I

Kelly  17:48  
actually just meant to tell everybody. They're dumb. Like, yeah, yes. But yeah, I can totally do I can totally do some kind of blog post about publishing the kp. I know, people have opinions about selling on Amazon. But the reality is, so many people own a Kindle. And so when people want to read ebooks on their Kindle, so I wanted to make it accessible there. So good

Ali  18:09  
tip. The other thing, though, just to say is that if you're interested in that speech text idea, we use otter AI to transcribe all of our podcast episodes, that could be another option for Texas, or speech to text.

Kelly  18:22  
That is absolutely true. So, um, let's talk about where to sell your ebook. So I mentioned. Again, I think we all kind of took a different route to doing this. I do sell mine on Amazon via KDP, which is I think, Kindle Direct Publishing is what it stands for. And I sell it on there for 999 as opposed to $10. Because they actually, like tear how much you can make based on the price you're selling the book for. And $10 pushes you to only get like 30% of it, versus 60% of it is really dumb. So I priced it at 999 on there. I primarily sell my books through Shopify, though, which I was basically told as a shop by agency, if I don't use Shopify to sell my ebook, there are people who are going to come after me and scold me, so I decided to make them happy. This is definitely a more hands on approach to selling your book. But since I live in Shopify, it was pretty much it's it was it is an easy thing for me to do.

Emma  19:24  
That's like if I created music and only put on Apple Music. Yeah,

Kelly  19:28  
yeah. So that's what I'm, so you'll need a digital downloads app in order to actually deliver the book. So digital downloads is is an app that was built by Shopify, I believe it's free. I personally use an app called sendowl. Because you can re upload the files and make sure they get delivered to everybody. It has like fraud checks built in. So if Shopify flags an order that comes in like a, I don't know if this is actually the person who is purchasing it, it doesn't automatically send them the book. You have to actually authorize them to get access to it and it has to Nice reporting in there too. So you can kind of see a breakdown of how the sales are coming in, change people's email addresses that they, you know, change their address, whatever. The one thing to know about selling on Shopify is that as a business owner on Shopify, you do need to make sure you're managing your own taxes. And this is a conversation I have with merchants all the time, especially new ones, there is something, okay, let's start with this. If you're based in the US, you need to look at what your state's sales tax rules are, especially around selling digital content. Some states require you to charge sales tax for it, others don't. And then if you plan on delivering that book internationally, you also have to deal with the tax. And wow, I am blanking on the word. Thank you. And like all the different countries varieties of VAT, which literally changes from country to country, whether in the EU, whether you're not and then just like various countries, everyone has their own rules, you have to register your business in those different countries as well. It is some work. If you're going to go this route, please get a CPA to help you navigate the tax situation,

Emma  21:09  
or just use a platform that takes care of that floor. Yes, is important for me, I'm gonna get screwed on my taxes this year. And I don't, it keeps me awake at night, it's fine. So I was previously using one popular platform to sell my ebook, I don't sell there anymore. And I'm not going to even mention their name, I'm only going to mention the ones that I would recommend. Pay hip is the one that I'm currently using. And I absolutely love them. I pay a monthly fee. But it's very, it's pretty affordable. It's like maybe 10 or $15 a month. And the UI is beautiful. The analytics are great. I love it. podia is another really great online platform from selling for selling digital content, but it is much more expensive to host your content there. But yeah, I'd still recommend it. Like if you're going to sell full blown courses, I think podia is a great way to go. And those are the I actually checked out leanpub as well, when I was publishing, you can even make your ebooks and lean pub. But to be honest, the UI is very unintuitive. Like their user, their information architecture is a fucking mess. And so I would always get confused. I think it's awful. I don't recommend this to beginners, if you know how to use it fantastic. But those are my three,

Ali  22:25  
I can talk about two other. So ConvertKit ConvertKit is who are used for emails, and they are kind of the one of the top of the line kind of email newsletter brands, they are really good at doing like automations and targeting certain audiences

Emma  22:43  
sequences,

Ali  22:44  
they're really great platform. And they actually now have a toolkit for processing payments and things too. So you can have a sales page through ConvertKit. And what's really nice is then your email list is integrated into how you sell the product. I think it's still in beta. I'm not 100% sure on that. But it is something that I know people are using. And I have been using ConvertKit for like two years for my email list. And they are really nice because they do like the forums for you too. So you can just have like a landing page that people sign up for your email list on. It's how I did my free book as well. So it's this really nice automation, you just set it up to send the person a PDF as soon as they sign up for your email list. And there's not much more to it than that. So that's really nice. The other thing that I've been using recently for a different project is stripe. And they have really nice API's for payment processing. And so you could kind of create your own a payment through that if you wanted to.

Emma  23:52  
I think one problem with stripe, though is that it doesn't work in a lot of countries. I think, really, if I'm not mistaken. Well, I don't know if that's just for people producing like people looking to use it to sell things or if it's also for consumers. But I know this was a problem with medium because people they use stripe to pay for medium and a lot of people can.

Kelly  24:13  
Yeah, it's depending on how they actually like how credit card payments are accepted. There are certain countries that don't do credit cards, they only take debit cards, or they only issue debit cards and stripe for some countries cannot actually take debit card payments for whatever reason. Also keep in mind if you're also going your own route and doing things through via stripe, you're going to have to handle taxes,

Ali  24:34  
as well. So I just looked at their site. If stripe is supported in your country, then you can accept payments from anywhere in the world but you have to be living in a country that stripe accepts. So it's like United States, most of Europe, India, Australia and Brazil it looks like in this map. So definitely not the whole entire world. But if you want to like roll your own in a way that I think stripe is the best known payment processor for that.

Kelly  25:01  
Yeah, it's also worth noting like if you want to just sell your if you want to build like a WordPress site, you can use easy digital downloads through WordPress and do the same thing. You can use MailChimp for landing pages you can even sell via like Squarespace. Yeah, I mean, there's so many different options there as well just basically, if they have e commerce functionality, you can probably sell through them. These are just the ones that we have experience with, or we know a little bit better about Yes, for sure. So let's talk about pricing. There are all kinds of different pricing strategies you can take to actually sell an E book. And this was something that I kind of battled with at the beginning. Because, you know, when I'm buying a book from like a famous author, I'm usually paying no more than like $10 for it. And so for me to charge $20 for my first ebook is kind of like, Are people actually going to buy this. And it turns out that people do. And so I feel like technical ebooks or like a niche specific ebooks have a very different pricing strategy compared to a lot of other situations. Not to mention, a lot of these famous authors selling books, or like via publishers are usually selling at a much higher volumes as well, compared to you know, most people selling their own ebooks. So I do want to mention that I want to preface with that. So let's talk about some different pricing strategies you can take to actually sell your ebook.

Emma  26:26  
You had mentioned previously about like giving away free ebooks. My take on that is you, I like I agree. But it doesn't have to be a whole ebook. So what I'm doing for mine is, I have my full ebook. And the free portion of that is a five email sequence of things that are you could expect to find in the book. So mine is all about the technical interview process. So I have an email about algorithms that goes through a sorting and searching algorithm with all the code and everything. And it says if you want to see the rest of them, you can go by with the full ebook. And I have one I'm big O notation as well. And I have some exercises in email. So it's a free email course of five email course. But it gives you a glimpse into what you can expect if you buy the full version. And I think that conversion is really smart. I don't think it needs to be a full ebook. But yeah, to your point, like giving away free content is the best way to build a relationship with your consumers.

Ali  27:22  
Yeah, for sure. I like it. Because having an email list is pretty much the most valuable thing you can have for marketing purposes. Just having that touch point with people because they're gonna check their email. And you don't have to rely on an algorithm as much as you do for social media. And so for me building up like an 11,000 person email list through offering a free ebook that was like 40 pages or something like that it wasn't huge, by any means. Wasn't a novel. I think that that worked out really well for me personally. But again, like, it depends on your goals, right? I think if your goal is to make money off of it, obviously, don't make it free. But if your goal is to potentially build a list so that you can sell something else in the future, this would be a great strategy. Or if your goal is to just like give back to the community, that's another thing as well. So it really depends on your your goals.

Kelly  28:24  
I agree. Okay, so one of the things that I've seen others do is set the price of the ebook, lower during a pre sale and then increase the price to higher amount at launch. Emma, didn't you do this? I did do this.

Emma  28:41  
And to be honest, it is a great way to make money. If it all goes down to like the, the scarcity principle, and not even that's different. That's offering a set quantity. And once they're gone, they're gone. That's the scarcity principle. I don't know what this principle of marketing is called. But it is definitely a tactic where like, it's a it's going to expire after a certain time. So I only offered mine for a month. And then after that month, I took it off the market slash the price is going to go up. Yeah, I mean, honestly, it's a really great marketing tactic. To be fair, I also gave away a lot of free copies of my ebook as well to people who couldn't afford it, I think actually, price. You know, one of the tips we have on here for pricing is to like buying power varies from country to country. We'll touch on that in a second. But for people who can't afford it, offering a discount code or get donating copies to underrepresented people in tech, or you know, whatever it may be, those are really great because they show that you're not just in this for the money like you genuinely care about people.

Kelly  29:47  
Yeah, so that's something that I actually did on my site. So a few things. I never changed the price of the book. It was always $20 for the E book. However, I added a discount code to my site that's permanently there. 24 seven, that's just basically I say, you know, if you want the book, but you can't, can't afford to pay full price, use this discount code, I don't care who uses it. And I see, like, you know, as orders are continuing to come in, I can see how many people are using the discount code, or how many people are not, I don't care one way or the other, I'm very, you know, fortunate to be in a position where I am able to not care because it's additional supplemental income. But I feel like it's definitely something that I am offering. And then again, I offer a bundle as well. So if you want the E book and the audio book, it's $30, instead of $40.

Emma  30:40  
Yeah, that's the thing I was gonna mention is add ons with different features, or different tiers is like, have like a base model. It's just the E book, it's priced at a reasonable price. And I think, in general, for an E book, depending upon the length of it, like, I priced mine at $10, which is, I think, too low. And I've been told it was way too low. But I was doing this for the benefit of the community, etc. It really depends on like, what you're you're aiming for, I think people generally will pay no more than like $30 for an E book. 30 seems kind of high. I actually priced my blogging book at 30. But that included all of my financials. And then I think like the original book was just 15 or 20. But when you get into digital content in terms of books, like I don't know, I feel like I don't see a lot above 30. It kind of depends on like, what you're getting and how much content it is. It better be a lot of content if

Kelly  31:27  
you're paying more than 30. Yeah,

Ali  31:29  
I think the other thing that you can kind of do, and I don't know your thoughts about this, but I've seen people saying that you should market it as a course instead of an E book if you want to charge a higher price for it. And then you can kind of change the formatting of it to be more course like and have similar content, and then put it on a higher price point. I've seen that advice. I don't know necessarily, if that's

Emma  31:53  
I think that's great if it truly is interactive, because like if I'd be pissed if I paid like $50 for a quote unquote, course. And it was just a book basically.

Kelly  32:02  
Yeah. Like I would just DIY PDF course.

Emma  32:06  
Yeah, you need to remember, the higher the price point, the higher the expectations. So if you're pricing it at $50, I would expect video courses, I would expect challenges I would expect, like coding challenges with solution walkthrough. Like, the higher the price, the higher the expectations, just be aware of that for sure.

Kelly  32:23  
Yeah. Okay, and now to touch on buying power, purchasing power and a little bit more detail here. It's important to understand exchange rates from one country to the next. And what is $20 USD is a lot more money in other countries. And so you if you want to have international reach for your book, it's really important to understand and recognize the fact that 20 US dollars is a lot of money in some countries. And that's why I offer the discount code to to kind of make up for that. The other one that we don't actually have on this list is just pay what you want.

Emma  33:04  
Yeah, those are no it. Yeah, yeah,

Ali  33:07  
that's another good one. I also know somebody who has been paying it, like the first 10 people get it for this price, the next 100 people get it for x price, the next 1000 people get it for this price, which is really interesting as well. And I don't know how that's worked out. But I've heard about it. The other one that I want to mention back to that course thing is that, do you remember refactoring UI? Yeah, so they came out with a book, but they kind of branded it as more than a book, and I bought it. And the full thing is $149. So much more of a higher price point than we've been discussing. And they have a couple of bonuses to it like videos. And the videos come with the $79 version. But then the 149 has a bunch of like color palettes and fonts and things like that. So that's another way to kind of make your offering a little bit more bulky is to add something else to it. Maybe that's like site templates, or that design guidelines or something along those lines, examples or a couple screencasts. And that can make it go for a much higher price point because we talked about 30. But like 79 for just an E book with three additional video tutorials. That's a huge markup compared to what we were discussing. So just wanted to put that out there too.

Emma  34:29  
Yeah. And one out one person I want to shout out as the keema Prophet, she is currently selling an E book, but what she's doing is increasing the price at different date intervals, because she's releasing it chapter by chapter. And so every time she releases, the price is going to go up. So it's similar to increasing after X amount of people but it's just increasing after a certain date. Well, that's fun.

Kelly  34:51  
All right. So let's finish this with just some tips in general. My first tip is take care Time I published, like I said, I basically gave myself a month to write and edit and prepare my ebook for launch. And that was a very ambitious deadline while I hit it, I wish I had not rushed the process so much.

Emma  35:16  
So I did the same thing I self published in wrote and everything in 30 days, and I don't recommend it. Be fair, having accountability is a really great motivator. Sure,

Kelly  35:28  
like announcing a launch date is great, but maybe give yourself more than one month.

Emma  35:33  
Yeah. One of mine would be to display testimonials on your website. So once you have your book created, reach out to people in the industry that you respect, I recommend procuring a diverse list of testimonials as well, so that people from all over the world, from all different backgrounds are reading your content and can recommend it, it's gonna resonate with a lot more consumers as well. But yeah, get them to check it out, provide you a testimonial, and then add it to your website.

Ali  36:04  
Another one is to launch on products. And this made it so that my book went way beyond my audience. So there are different checklists out there for doing a Product Hunt launch. But Product Hunt is essentially a website that you post products when they launch on there. And for me, I got number four of the day, which isn't like number one or anything like that, but it still made it so that a bunch of people saw it. And I got to be seen by people outside of the people that I normally speak to like on my Twitter or whatever. So that's a that's a good one as well.

Kelly  36:37  
Um, have people proofread your book before you publish? This goes beyond especially if you will, okay. I I say get somebody to edit your book first. That's really helpful, but like, actually had people proofread it, and be open to feedback, honestly, like if if your book kind of sucks. And you're asking people who are going to give you like legitimate feedback, be open to that feedback as well.

Emma  37:03  
Yeah, one of my tips was to provide updates, as you're writing the book, I did this on Twitter, where I'd post screenshots, and to that point of getting feedback from your testimonials, get feedback from the public, because they're the ones consuming it. And what I found is what looks good to me. Turns out it's not accessible, like my font was not readable or the color scheme is not accessible. So these are the kinds of things you don't think about actively. So getting feedback is very important.

Ali  37:26  
Another one is just from a business perspective, thinking about what you legally and financially should do in order to protect yourself, I guess. So I personally do everything under an LLC that I have founded. But this is not business or financial advice, like go find your own people, I guess. But another thing that's been really helpful for me is having an accountant that manages all of the financial side for me, because that's something that's way beyond my knowledge, and somebody else can do it better and save me a lot of money. So that's something that I'd highly recommend doing if you are making significant income from online stuff is to get an LLC or get advice from an accountant on what to do.

Kelly  38:11  
You know, what's really cool about that as well is if you're working under an LLC, and you're selling your book under an LLC, you can actually open up another retirement account, let's say like a SEP IRA, for example, in put into retirement specifically from that account, so it kind of gives you like another retirement vehicle.

Ali  38:26  
Whoa, I didn't know that. That's really cool.

Kelly  38:29  
Yeah, I have three Sep IRAs. A collectible sees

Ali  38:34  
a rack of those policies,

Emma  38:35  
kind of along the same lines is like separating, you know, this content out into business entity, I recommend getting, like a business email. I have four emails, I don't want to talk about it. Maybe more. I I'm an email hoarder like Kelly Ward's LLC. Yes,

Kelly  38:51  
I ordered emails, I just consolidate it down to four.

Emma  38:54  
Yeah, it's stressful. But what I would say is more stressful is receiving business emails to your personal email and having to siphon through them. So I would recommend get a, a GS, I like G Suite a lot, I will swear by them, I recommend getting a G Suite account with a custom Gmail. So like buy a domain name, get yourself like a Hey, at like our podcast accounts. Hello at Ladybug Dev. So get yourself a domain, you can get a business email and separate work and personal

Kelly  39:22  
it's $6 a month or G Suite as well. So it's not a not a huge amount. And also I cannot express the number of emails I get soliciting work, to whom I tap from email from people's Gmail accounts. And I'm going to be completely honest, I complete like I immediately discount you know, they go to spam, a lot of them will go to spam.

Emma  39:39  
If it's a Gmail account,

Ali  39:41  
I think it to some extent comes across like you're not taking it super seriously. Exactly. You're coming from a Gmail and I don't know if that's a rightful assumption or not, but I think that having the company name on there does make it feel a little bit more legit.

Kelly  39:54  
Yeah. And touching on providing updates as you're writing the book, start building an email list. So you can all Not only provide emails or updates via Twitter or wherever else, you can actually continue to email your potential customers and keep them apprised on how you are, you know, proceed with writing and both get their feedback, get their input on what kind of things they want to see in the book. And yeah, I mean, I feel like once you launch, like we were ready to actually go live you Howard already had this audience built up to promote the book. I'm actually now using my email list for start freelancing today for publishing blog posts and promoting those.

Emma  40:25  
Yeah, and speaking of promoting, I think one of the biggest things was creating. I don't know what the term for this is, the longer I live abroad, the more I forget. But what is that called when like the month leading up, you're like hyping up your own content, like building hype, there is a technical term for it, and I can't remember what it is. But um,

Kelly  40:46  
we're going to call it building type,

Emma  40:48  
core building hype. If you have a launch date set, like you should be tweeting about it, you should be posting on Instagram stories, like don't feel bad marketing your own stuff, you're going to lose probably some followers in the process, because that's just turnover. But you will also gain a lot more.

Ali  41:05  
Yeah. One other thing is that we talked about a couple of things that will cost some money. So buying a domain getting your email list. Usually email providers cost a decent amount of money per month, depending on what when you use and like tiny letter doesn't cost very it or tiny Letter is free. But the problem is, once you get over a couple 1000 subscribers, you have to move off of it. And it's a really painful process. So most email providers are going to charge you and also the payment service provider that we have been talking about like Shopify and Katia and all those, they have charges per month as well. If you have an LLC or something like that, you can write those off as business expenses. So your tax is going to be I believe, non existent on it. Right, Kelly?

Kelly  41:52  
No, you're still gonna pay taxes. Okay? It is not it is unless you're spending more money than you're making, you're not going to have losses. So I mean, you're still going to pay taxes on it's not a full write off. It's not it's a it's a deduction, it's not a write off.

Ali  42:07  
There you go, you know this better than I do. But you save money. If you write things off as business expenses.

Kelly  42:13  
I'll never forget that. There was a business owner A few years ago, who was telling me about how she was going to buy herself a new MacBook Pro. And she had just bought one the previous year have been like, Yeah, well, that's a it's a write off. And like, her issue is like, yeah, I can just write it off on my taxes. And like, it's a deduction on your taxes. You own the business, you're still paying for that book?

Ali  42:32  
Oh, for sure. Yeah, that's not Yeah. I'm just mentioning this because it does make these things a little bit less expensive, then.

Kelly  42:41  
Yeah, might see. I'll see your accountant as business expenses. Well,

Emma  42:45  
if you're starting out creating an email list, I recommend MailChimp, it's super intuitive. It's much cheaper than ConvertKit at least in the beginning. ConvertKit is superduper powerful, and I personally don't think you need it until you're ready to really expand and create sequences and automations. But MailChimp is a great place to start and it's much cheaper,

Kelly  43:00  
completely agree and you can also build landing pages on MailChimp. And you can also actually MailChimp has ecommerce integration as well. So you can use it for everything if you really want to. Okay, let's round this out with shoutouts. Emma, do you want to go first? Yeah. So

Emma  43:17  
I started taking Swedish lessons. Which was why I was overly enthusiastic my jaw, so to speak my fourth language and I'm really excited about it. But I'm not excited to lose my German of my French. So yay, shout out to learning the same language that of the country I live in.

Kelly  43:33  
That's fun loving so many languages must be fun. I think about getting a Spanish tutor, because my Spanish is like the modern Spanish. I know it's stressful. So

Emma  43:45  
I want to fix that. But I just think, well, you have a Spanish speaking mother. But unless you have like a language speaking parent or someone in your life or you live in a country, it's really hard to keep up with it. For sure.

Kelly  43:58  
Allie, what's your shout out.

Ali  44:00  
I've been doing some clubhouse chats the last couple weeks and it's not perfect by any means. There are definitely issues with it but I've been having a lot of fun with it. And I really liked that. It allows you to have almost a decentralized conversation like you can ask anybody to come up so it's a little bit less unidirectional than a lot of social media. The other nice thing is that usually for streaming and stuff you have to get already and like look decent for video and you don't have to do that for this. So

Kelly  44:28  
I've been having no reference when I agree. My shout out is her company called our place. It's from our place.com I got their pin for Christmas and I am obsessed with it. It cleans so easily. You don't have to use like a ton of olive oil when you're cooking. It has like rights. It has like a built in kind of thing for and it gives you like a like a utensil to use for it. It comes with a steamer. I, I love it. I got the one and say

Emma  45:06  
I want one. So how you can you personally ship me one because they don't ship to Sweden,

Kelly  45:12  
I can do that.

Emma  45:13  
It's gonna cost forever, or

Kelly  45:15  
it's gonna cost forever.

Emma  45:16  
I probably will. So maybe I should take English lessons.

Kelly  45:21
