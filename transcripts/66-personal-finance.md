It's no secret that a major perk to working in development is the salary developers are often paid higher than the average salary. And as you move up in a company, you can see significant growth in your income. We all know financial literacy is often skipped in early education, which is why this week we're talking all things financial planning with our special guest, Shannon Lee Simmons to teach you what you need to know about managing your finances as a high earner. Welcome to the ladybug podcast. I'm Kelly.

Shannon  0:31  
I'm Cindy. I'm Allie.

Shannon  0:32  
And I'm Emma. And we're debugging techniques.

Kelly  0:36  
All right, Shannon, thank you so much for joining us today.

Shannon  0:39  
Oh, thanks for having me. This is great.

Kelly  0:41  
I would love to kick things off by learning a little bit more about you and what you do.

Shannon  0:45  
Sure. So I am a certified financial planner and a chartered investment manager by trade and by credential but I also founded and own and operate the new school of finance, which is a fee only financial planning company in Canada.

Kelly  1:00  
What does it mean to be fee only?

Shannon  1:02  
This is a great question. So a lot of times people will get financial advice. But you know, you get it from somebody who's selling you, your rsps. In Canada, for example, your retirement accounts to your investments. So maybe you don't write you know, you don't actually send the money transfer, pay for it out of pocket, like you would like a lawyer or an accountant, you're paying for it with the investments that you have, or with the insurance products that you have. And so inherently someone giving you advice that sells you, either investments or insurance is biased, you know, so if you want to ask, Can I pay off my mortgage? Or should I invest? If they're making money off of you from investments? Obviously, they're, they're biased towards saying, well, let's invest that into Sam. So yeah, so what we do is called the only which means you pay for our time similar to like a lawyer or an accountant, where I have no skin in the game financially, whether you pay off your mortgage or invested. So if I tell you to invest it, it's because I actually think that's the best thing for your holistic financial planning picture, rather than where I'm going to get my bonus from. So that's what we do.

Sidney  2:00  
So where exactly can we find other financial advisors? Just like you, I know that you're working in Canada? So we're in the US, of course, so where could we potentially find other financial advisors that are like you?

Shannon  2:13  
Yeah, I think, you know, anywhere in the world, just popping into a search engine. And, you know, looking specifically for the words fee, only financial planner versus the word financial advisor, I think the planning piece is really important as a differentiator, and that we're the only also sometimes internationally we're referred to as advice only, again, because you're paying for advice, versus a product. And so if you put that into like a local search engine, you probably come up with a bunch of directories, there's tons of them internationally, like, you know, they're, they're there. I think that it's kind of the financial planning industry is moving towards something I've been doing it now for over a decade. And the the shifts I've seen any interest in this in the last six years has been mind blowing, I think more and more people want to pay for advice and then implement elsewhere. If

Kelly  2:58  
that makes sense. That's actually that's what we do. So we have a financial adviser who we just meet with to kind of like, pulse check where we are, but we kind of do everything ourselves.

Shannon  3:08  
That's right. The other

Kelly  3:09  
thing is in the States, and I don't know if this is specifically to the US, we often look for the word fiduciary. Yeah, as far as somebody who's kind of legally obligated to act in your best interest, as opposed to, as you explained, tell you to invest because they're gonna make money from it.

Shannon  3:24  
Yeah, that's right. And I think also making sure that you're looking for those credentials, right? So someone who's like a certified financial planner, and that's also the same in the US as well. And so that you're because there's not a lot of regulation, at least in Canada around who can call themselves a financial planner. And so you really want to make sure that somebody is held to that, like, fiduciary duty and that higher standard of care,

Shannon  3:46  
to know for sure.

Kelly  3:48  
So what does that mean? Does it mean to be a high earner? Because I feel like that could kind of vary by definition.

Shannon  3:54  
100% I think you just nailed it. I think it depends on what somebody considers a high earner for themselves. So here's where I would say somebody as a high earner. I think there's two perspectives to keep in mind. I think that there's the financial industry, and what they consider the elusive day, high earners. So there's this weird acronym and I used to work on Bay Street, which is Canada's version of Wall Street. And there's this acronym at the time that used to irk me. It was when you would target young earners, and they were called Henry's.

Kelly  4:23  
That's actually a term that's used I'm an e commerce and we use Henry's as a description of who's buying what earner not rich yet.

Shannon  4:32  
Oh, I've never heard of that before. That's fascinating. Okay.

Shannon  4:36  
So these would be people that we you know, from like a sales point of view you would be targeting because they are considered high earners, and there's lots of potential so these are people usually making around six figure plus. And so there's that definition, but that's not the definition that I actually use, because I see with people I see people from all walks of life, because we don't need those the high earners or, you know, certain assets under management to be To have have somebody as a client, I think someone is a high earner when they have an after tax cash flow or after tax, or after deductions like money coming in on a monthly basis or an annual basis, where they can pay their bills in a in a home that they love, whether it's rented or owned, it's a place that they feel safe, secure and proud of. That's number one. They have the transportation needs met again, however they want it. So some people love, you know, taking transit and riding bikes. And some people want to own a car that they can drive around. It depends on what you need. But they can do that without stressing about the financial aspect of that they have there they have insurance in place, that's enough to just cover risk. So they can afford to do that if they lose their job or whatever, like that pieces is on lockdown. They're saving enough for retirement. So again, what is enough, but they're able to put away money that makes them feel like they have a plan for the long run. And that is it's not putting so much anxiety on the day to day grind of life. And last but not least, I guess they're paying attention to what they're spending. I mean, I don't think anybody even if you're a high earner, except for like, you know, Warren Buffett and that kind of level of wealth, you can just make it rain all the time. That's not really a realistic thing. But you have enough spending money that you don't feel broke 24 seven? I think to me, that's a high earner. And here's the catch with that. I see people who have six figure incomes all the time, who don't, I would not consider that because they have leveraged themselves too high with a house they can't really afford or their expenses are too high. So yeah, the number on your day on your T bar, which is our you know, a tax time what we get to tell the government what we earn, so you can pay taxes. So that number might be high. But are you a high earner if everything you earned is already promised to someone else, and you're going into debt? So I think, I think high earner, there's a concept of it. And then there's a lifestyle.

Sidney  6:47  
That's a really holistic take. And I really appreciate you actually saying that, because that's something that I'm still trying to figure out myself when it comes to being a high earner and as a developer, and I think that one of the biggest questions that I see, as well as like having myself is whether you should be trying to save more money as the goal to be more of a high earner, or pay off your debt first to then kind of help that kind of be a reduced risk and cost for yourself in the long run. So how do you decide kind of what to do with your money to become a high earner?

Shannon  7:23  
Yeah, I think that we need to come back to this concept of net worth. So net worth is a jargony way of saying like, what do you like, what do you own? Yeah, the end of the day. So you know if your net worth is everything that you own, so all of your assets, minus all of your liabilities are everything that you owe. So to use a really quick example, that you know that the really like, typical example is okay, well, I own a house and it's worth $500,000. But my mortgage is 300,000. So my net worth is 200,000. So when you see like, oh, that house is worth 500,000. But like if that person's mortgage is super high, then that's their net worth is reduced by that, right? And if you are, if you're a renter, that it's like okay, well add up everything in your retirement accounts or in your savings accounts, and then subtract any debts that you have. So if you're in the US, and you have a 401k with 100,000 in it, but then you also have student debt of 80,000, then your net worth is 20,000. So I think that that is a really important concept to answer this question, because I think it feels really emotionally satisfying to build savings. We you know, it's very forward looking, what am I saving for, it's for the future to be satisfying. And then to pay off debt, whether it's student debt or credit card debt from something or like line of credit, feels yucky. So it feels really good to see $1,000 go into your retirement account than it does to see a student line of credit go from 20,000 to 19,000. But I would argue from a financial planning perspective, the net, the impact on your net worth is the exact same you can even prove your net worth by 1000 bucks, whether you put it into a savings account or paid off $1,000 of principal, wow, I'm stoked about it either way. But I this is why this question is so fraught, because I think that I think people logically know like, yeah, paying down debt is good, but it doesn't have the same emotional when a saving and so people pay their minimums or struggle with debt in a different way. Because it's not as fun. So I would say, how do you balance it? Well, for me, if we know that your net worth is increasing, no matter what and paying off debt is a form of savings, that's like a perspective shift that really needs to happen for people that I would look at the return on investment. So if you've got a line of credit, that's charging you you know, 6% guaranteed every every single like you're paying that monthly interest all the time, what investment product is going to guarantee you 6% I don't know if there is one that's gonna guarantee it. If you invest it, maybe but it might also have volatility and go down. So if you look at the math there, I think that we can get outside with the mathematics behind paying down debt. And then the other thing that I would, I often will say to people is the actual The long term emotional labor of paying down debt often trumps the short term win of pay of saving. So like that first initial inertia is hard. But when you see it actually working, and you can see the finish line, you really feel like you've accomplished something, because that has a way of making us feel bad with money. Even when we're not.

Kelly  10:16  
I had to laugh, the what was actually going to give you a 6% guaranteed 6% return it just it made me laugh, because high yield savings accounts used to actually be high yield savings accounts like like Marcus, for example, is now like, a half percent interest. So still better than like a checking account is like point 01 percent. It's still like 50 times that, but it's just it's kind of funny, putting into perspective, like there really is no guarantee and that kind of return.

Shannon  10:45  
No, no, not a guarantee, I think that you can, you know, project and hope for and sometimes it'll happen, but sometimes it won't. And so so I think that that word guarantee is really an important one, for sure.

Kelly  10:57  
So in terms of net worth, I know there are benchmarks that exist on the internet, as far as like, here's where you should be based on your age. And I again, I know that everyone's living situations very different, especially, you know, being in a more high earning career path. Yeah. Should we care about these benchmarks?

Shannon  11:18  
No, I absolutely think that's like asking, what should I weigh? I think it's exact same bullshit, sorry, I swear, I don't know, you're finally, thank you for saying check the rating rating. So I think that you can get caught up with trying to meet goals that don't work for you. The comparison game is fraught the FOMO the resentment of your own situation, all of this shit is so unhealthy through your relationship with money, your relationship with your career in your relationship with your with your colleagues. And don't focus on something like that focus on what you need, and how you're going to get that given what you're working with. And then make goals that are realistic within that stratosphere and you will be a happier, healthier person, for sure, I have been doing this for a long, long time. And the comparison game is fraught and all all those benchmarks do or make people afraid. And often they come from the financial industry, which is trying to get you to save more to make them more money. So the more you terrify people that they don't save enough, the more money they're going to throw in at RSP season in Canada are like they're gonna panic and do that. And and so, yes, saving is good, of course, and nobody, we have to have boundaries. And there has to be a concerted mindful effort with money. I'm not saying that. But what I'm saying is these like flatline, here's where you should be by this age is, is No, please don't anyone listening to this, please don't pay attention to that get something customized for yourself, because that's the only way that you're actually gonna be able to celebrate your own wins.

Sidney  12:52  
So then that gives me a kind of a segue to another question, Where should you keep your money? Like, I know that having it just kind of sitting in a bank and a savings account isn't the greatest but like, should it just to be keep it liquid? Should we keep it in investments? How do you think that should work?

Shannon  13:08  
Yeah, this is like the million dollar question. But I will give some, I'll give some feedback on that. So I think the first thing that everybody wants to do is check in and see if you have any consumer debt, I know that that's like the age old, boring, young thing to say. And but if you have, you know, consumer debt, that's like charging 19% on a credit card, or a really high line of credit, I'm not talking about like a car loan or a mortgage, I'm talking about consumer debt, that's expensive. And also causing that like chaos or feeling like you don't have control of your money because that that feeling alone is really detrimental to your finances. So, so focusing money there first, if you do have free cash, cash, like after you pay your bills, and you have your spending life, and now you're like, Hey, I have, I can do something with this $1,000 a month or $500 a month, or whatever that chunk is, after you've paid your bills, and you're and you've eaten, and like lived your life. So what do I do with that, so let's put it onto consumer debt first. Because it is building your net worth. So you're not going to have great retirement, if you are constantly sinking into debt, it's all going to catch up to you, you're not going to qualify for as much of a mortgage that you might want to qualify for if you have bad credit from delicate impacts everything. Um, and so let's deal with that consumer debt first. Again, not talking about mortgage or even student debt. I mean, I think that that's more of a like a conversation to be had, but I'm not, I think some student debt you can just like, pay the minimum let it ride because it depends on how much like if especially with some people in the US that have like, I often say a mortgage on their brain, you know, a six figure amount Are you never going to save anything until that thing's God? So I think I think student debt is something that I can, you know, depends on the person depends on their income depends on the situation but consumer debt No, it's a it's a big one that we want to tackle first. Then we want to make sure that we have an emergency account which again until the pandemic didn't get a lot of love, not very sexy, like you know, putting it into a high interest savings account that's liquid felt boring and annoying, especially when you hear about people making much more by investing their money or doing other more risky things. However, that emergency account can act like a blanket of calm if you lose your job, or if there is a pandemic, for your health, take a dive. And again, someone who's seen that happen in real time. Over the years, he's, you start preaching about it more, because you see how important it is when you when you look back at how many people like I'll never forget, when the pandemic hit, I had over 350 meetings during the first lockdown. And, and the people who had emergency accounts are just less stressed, it doesn't mean that they weren't stressed, they were just less stressed. And I think that is huge. And so consumer debt, a little bit of Mad Money for your emergency account that you're storing away just in case the worst happens. And then once those two things are on lockdown, that's when we start to play with the more fun investment stuff. And then at that point, I think like, yeah, throw it into your long term accounts, your retirement accounts, whatever. And you want to make sure that you are investing in at that point, because that's when keeping it liquid. And interest rates is silly, because that's the money that you're trying to grow. And so because the time horizon is much longer, you can handle a little bit more volatility, whereas you know, if your roof leaks tomorrow, you can handle the volatility on your $2,000 emergency account. So I think it's like kind of in phases, how we prioritize it. And then we get to the really fun stuff once you kind of got your house in order. Nice.

Kelly  16:23  
In terms of the emergency account. Do you have a recommendation for how much somebody should have in there? Like you usually hear like between three and six months worth of expenses? Yeah,

Shannon  16:31  
you like that's so unrealistic for somebody? Really? Yeah.

Shannon  16:35  
Right? Imagine your life costs four grand a month. What are you supposed to have? 16? It sounds insane. I feel like the average person high earner or not the amount of time you would take to get to that goal. Crazy. So here's what I here's what I would say I think yes, I am, I am forced to say you should have three months worth of living expenses. This is what everybody expects me to say. And I think if you inherit a bunch of money, or you get a massive payout, and you can, here's my $15,000 emergency fund, great. Like, if you can do that, that's awesome, you'll feel very secure. What I really think you should be thinking about is an emergency account works in two ways. One, we want that initial amount, like a like a little amount. And I usually say if people are not sure start with the idea of five grand like a $5,000 cushion, that would that $5,000 pay your bills for one month, or like six weeks and allow you to eat for for at least one month or six weeks like it would it pay for most typical house emergencies. Or most typically, oh my god, this broken like, Oh my God, this happened, oh my god moments wouldn't pay for most of the typical ones. I'm not talking about like, well, I need to spend 50,000 for a roof tomorrow, I'm talking about the like, Oh, shit moments, right? start there. And if you feel like it's not enough for your life, and you know, try maybe 7500 is the right amount. If you feel like that's overkill, and that would see you through, you know, maybe you're a fire person, which is like, you know, financial independence, retire early, and that would be six months alone. So starting with five grand and kind of seeing where that would go, and then ratcheting it up for trying to make it at least I think six weeks. And if you're any tech, you probably have, you're probably able to get a job faster if you got laid off or like think about what your emergency is and how long you'd have to go without it without income. And then the second piece that I think is actually more important that doesn't get talked about a lot is that it's not about reaching $5,000 and then chilling, it's actually been actively putting money away every month, 200 bucks, 150 bucks, whatever that is to build on top of that, so that you continue to use it above that 5000 you kind of keep that 5000 as your nugget. So a great example is I had this client who was like, he had his 5000. And then he kept putting $200 away into this slush fund or mercy account or whatever you want to call it. And then like his laptop broke, and then this happened. And then this happened. And this happened. We met the next year. He was like, I'm so mad. I was putting all this money aside and I only I still am back the 5000. I'm like, Yeah, great. That means it's working good for you. You didn't put that on debt. And he was like, thinking because I'm saving. It's supposed to be accumulating, but an emergency account doesn't work like that. It's there to keep you out of debt. It's not there to build your net worth.

Shannon  19:12  
That makes a lot of sense.

Kelly  19:14  
Okay, so I have a fun question. One thing that I I personally like talking about, and this is around the idea of lifestyle creep. So especially if you're maybe a second career in developments, maybe you weren't making, you know, 75,000 a year to six figures a year and suddenly you are and then suddenly you have all this money available to you. It's really easy to kind of creep into spending a lot more of that. So how do you balance avoiding lifestyle creep, but also being able to enjoy your money?

Shannon  19:45  
Yeah, this is something that a lot of my clients here in tech deal with. I like especially as that that second career thing is so real. So I think that there's two things that happen. One people who've been living on the cheap for so long, all of a sudden they have they're either like I can't spend it And they almost hoard money. And that's from like, you know, maybe a decade or scraping by and not even knowing how to have a lifestyle creep because they're so used to being hand to mouth, which I don't think is the healthy way to live either. And then there's the other is like mega. So. So I think that it's a balance, I think in the short run, if you're starting to earn this money, I think that it's you can give yourself permission to I feel like the the lifestyle upgrades that make you feel safe, secure and proud. I think that's like, those are the words I always come back to. So if somebody has been not earning a lot for a long time, and you know, they've been renting with roommates, and they're very frustrated about that, like that would be an immediate like lesson that you don't have to keep you have the income now, a little bit of it to like make you live in a place that you are excited about. Because some people love that and they don't want to leave it some people are like I can't wait to get out into money is the only reason I'm here. And so that would be something that would be an immediate, like, emotional return on investment. Like that's good. And like, again, transportation tends to be one of those upgrades to that happens or planning to buy a house. And like trying to work out what trying not to be house poor, or something that you've got this income and maybe buying a house was never on the table for you before. And now all of a sudden it is. And so I think I think that it's striking the balance comes down to mapping it out. I know that sounds ridiculous, but having your plan. So what can you spend without guilt? I think that's like really the the emotion that we're trying to avoid here. Because you should be able to spend some of your hard earned money without guilt. I think, you know, we're not just on this planet to save. So what can you spend without guilt before you put yourself in a situation where you're actually making yourself nervous again, so you're just as fine. You're just as financially scared as you were before you were earning the money, because now you're not saving anything, but you feel like you should be. And so I think I think that it's about getting that like customized boundary for yourself, making sure that your housing, your transportation game is fine, and then carving out a chunk of your money that is for guilt free spending on whatever it is. And then but also just making sure that there you are being strategic with the money that you're putting aside. And that will give you that nice balance between I'm allowed to spend there. I can spend this without feeling guilty about it, because I'm doing this.

Shannon  22:15  
Okay, that's that's a great way to put it.

Kelly  22:18  
Yeah, I was talking to my my financial advisor yesterday, actually. And I was like, could we stop flying coach? Yes. That was my question is, it was really good. Like, you know, it for us, it has always been like, if we upgrade our flights, that means we're taking away from something else that we could be spending that money on, he was like, well change your mindset about it. Instead, save to buy a more expensive flights. And then as he said, you can kind of go about it guilt free, because you literally save to do that specific thing.

Shannon  22:50  
Yeah. And if you're doing the, like other stuff, the other work, like you're putting money into your retirement accounts, you're building those emergency accounts paying off the debt, then you then who cares? Like you didn't mean to you're not sacrificing anything. Like that's, that's important. You're still paying your bills, and you're putting yourself up for the long run. So like, go for it. Yeah.

Sidney  23:09  
Awesome. Thank you for that. I know that we have an international audience. So without getting too specific about the different types of retirement accounts out there. What kind of general advice would you give to our larger audience on how, how they can figure out ways to save for retirement, the different types of ways that they can save for retirement?

Shannon  23:32  
Yeah, I think that there's a couple things that you want to just think about. And you'll have to like search this out in your own home home country. So you want to make sure it's tax sheltered. So most of the like, you know, d 20 countries have some sort of tax sheltered investment accounts. And a tax shelter means less. So you know, you buy something for $10, you sell it for $15, you got a $5 gain. And so if it's a tax shelter, as long as it's in that account, you're not paying tax on that five bucks. So what happens when it comes down is different depending on the account, but as long as it's in there, and it's a tax shelter, you're not paying tax on the money that you're earning while you go. So you know, that it can be really helpful. So most countries have that. So making sure that it's a tax shelter. The other thing that you want to be looking at is whether or not you have an account at your disposal, that would be a tax deduction. So that's different than a tax shelter. So in Canada, the RSP and the 401k, I believe in the US are examples of that where you know, if you make $100,000 a year and you put $10,000 into a tax deduction, or into an account that all of your contributions qualify as a tax deduction. Well, now you're only going to pay tax on $90,000. So you might get a refund of tax, you might owe less at tax time if you're self employed. So that can be a really good tax saving strategy while you're in these high earning years. And then when you're in retirement, yes, you might pay tax on the money when it comes out, but at a much lower rate. That's the second thing I'd be looking for. So tax sheltering tax deductions for that tax planning piece, especially if you're a high earner. And then last but not least I think you just want to make sure that you're putting enough away. And again, this is that like, Don't listen to those blueprints, this would be somewhere where I would really seek out a customized. I mean, this is where I am biased, I am biased towards getting unbiased advice. financially. I, I think that the one time expense of paying for someone to sit down and map out where you're going and what you're capable of doing, and maybe you actually think you have to put away more than you actually do. Maybe you don't I mean, like, so like, there might be some relief in that. And, and with a couple of tweaks, you can make the most out of your money so that you can still have a life. And so I think getting that number for yourself and for your household that is is so important that you have full faith that you're doing it strategically. And you're also doing it like doing an app. That makes sense.

Kelly  25:47  
So I have I have a question something that my husband and I actually kind of battled with for a long time before finally seeing a financial advisors. There's obviously a cost to seeing somebody about this, when is the right time to actually see somebody I guess, where you're actually going to get the most benefit out of the the cost that you're paying?

Shannon  26:07  
Well, it depends on the cost, I think so one thing that like useful finance, we try to be really accessible. And I don't mean I what I mean is that it can be really expensive. So I've tried to take a model that needs to be accessible to people who, who aren't able to spend like $3,000 on a plan, which is bananas. And so like, you know, a $3,000 retirement plan, if you're just starting out may not be appropriate that you don't even like so much is going to change over the next 35 years for you How can you make a plan for 35 years from now today. So you might want to find a planner who's able to do smaller, more affordable meetings, while you're in these building years where your situation is changing constantly. So there's that piece. And so that, so making sure it's affordable and trying to fit there. And I think that there are those models out there. They're just not maybe the norm. The other thing that I would say is I get asked question like what you just said a lot, like, when is it too? When do you start? I also liken that to like, well, I don't want to go to the gym until I get my why. But I know that that's like a common thing I've actually had people say to me before, like I don't want, you know, they'll whisper it like, I don't want to I don't want to come in until I got my financial house in order. I'm like, that is exactly what I heard. And I'll say sometimes people like, you know, like an aesthetician who's like, seated, like, I'm sorry, girl, please like, it's like, I was like the same thing. I'm like, I've seen everything you cannot shock me like, my job isn't to shame you or to show it or to be shocked. My job is to look at a situation and find creative solutions. And so so like, but there is this shame with money that that can happen. So long way of saying I think everyone could benefit from doing it tomorrow at the right price. So So making sure that what you're getting is actually helpful for the next five years, I think that right there is a really good way to like navigate whether this is worth it or not. And you know, if it's helpful the next 12 months, that's even more valuable, because you can implement it like you can see the results of it. And the other thing to keep in mind is if you're paying out of pocket for something is often you won't need an annual check in unless things are really rapidly shifting in your life. So often you can pay once and then come back in, like, three years. And so if you amortize that out over three years, it's really, it's really not that and I have to say to people, like what would you pay your therapist? Like, you know, like, for that financial, peace of mind, that's,

Sidney  28:27  
that's a good way to think about it. Um, the The next thing I guess I can segue into this is that there are I feel like a lot of people that are in the tech industry, I know myself, I've been interested in in the fire movement, like having to, like retire early, trying to invest as much as you can have your salary, I've definitely started kind of looking into it myself. But what are your thoughts on it? And do you have clients? I can't say too much. But do you have clients that are like interested in that or trying to put their like, financial kind of like independence in that way?

Shannon  29:03  
Yeah, absolutely. I have. I have a toss up between it, I find my actual philosophy is that something like the fire movement works for a very small portion of the population. So a lot of people can't actually follow it in real life, because like, you know, there might be daycare, yeah. Like our mental health, that they they, you know, they can't literally spend that little. And so I think that fire is great for some people to actually follow what I think is groovy about the fire movement is that I think it puts saving on the radar for people in an accent in which you know, people will dilute down and take what they will from a movement and implemented into their own life. So I think it was really great from that point of view, as long as people aren't feeling like, you know, frustration of their own Failure to follow it that intensely. And the other thing I think about fire is that I think it speaks to a broader issue of this feeling of Semi hopelessness about the future that our generation is dealing with, with like climate change and the chaos of like, you know, global politics, especially in the last like four years. And I think that I think that there is this sense of automation that maybe you won't have a job in 15 years. And so there's this desperation to make sure that you make hay while the sun is shining, that you get out. And I also think it speaks to burnout in the tech that, you know, yes, you're making lots of money, but at what cost to your mental health. And so there's this like getting get out, be intense about it, and then you can do, then you can finally relax, you can finally be you can finally take care of yourself. So I have issues with it. If it's if that's the escape, that it's offering someone. And I think that you know, you're still going to have to do that level of work or being militant with yourself for a decade, at least, even if you're earning a lot. It's a long time and like, at what cost at what price like what's the bigger issue that you're escaping from? I think that I think that is a fear based decision. I think I think that's something that to ask yourself, if you're interested in fire, I have a lot of clients who are Burgos, they're into it. I love

Shannon  31:13  
condo vibes that you're giving with us right now, just that that makes me feel good about this.

Shannon  31:17  
I think that everybody, there isn't one right way to do money. And I think that maybe is like a newer way to think about money. Because people think it's math, and it's very black and white. And it's not at all we're human beings. We make emotional decisions. 90% of our life is made emotionally and the 10% is a spreadsheet

Kelly  31:36  
that I love how much focus you've put through through this entire interview was on like, on the emotional side of things is you're absolutely right. I mean, money is very much an emotional topic.

Shannon  31:46  
Yes, I'm also a certified life coach. And I think that Oh, there you go. Always. Yeah, I always make the joke that I'm like, just like I sit there with. Yes, this is a financial planning meeting. Just like coaching people. I love it. I love it.

Kelly  32:00  
Good combination. Yeah,

Shannon  32:02  
it's a rare wine. It's a rare wine. But an important one, I think,

Kelly  32:06  
for sure. So really common in the tech world are working for startups. And they don't always have a lot of capital to work with in terms of salaries. So two kinds of questions here. What are options and restricted stock units? And like, when should you consider potentially taking equity for a decrease in salary?

Shannon  32:28  
Yeah, okay. So I think that there's a couple things one, the distinction between an RSP versus a stock option. So ours user like free money, essentially. So you know, you get an option to buy, or you get vested shares, kind of whether you like it or not, so you don't have to buy them specifically. You're, you're granted them and then there's the vesting period, and then after the vesting period, whatever those shares are, they're yours. And so there's almost a guaranteed gain, as long as they're not completely at zero, there's a guaranteed game because you put no money out, I think that's like a really important distinction. And then once they vested, you can sell at some point, and they can translate into cash, or you can keep them as shares. So that's, that's the one piece of RSU stock option is different, you pay for it, you pay for the option to like, buy these stocks later. So an example of this is let's say that you buy the stock option to buy shares in your company at $20. And then there's also still a vesting period, and by the time you're invested, it's like the market value of those stocks is 100 bucks, well, now you have the option to buy them at 20. So that is, that's a game for you. And that's the stock options. So you've put money out on the bet that the future value is going up. So I think stock options are really good, if you believe so rsps are great, because it's free. It's free money, essentially, unless the company goes completely. You know, under under stock options or stock options can be very good if you think that there's this massive trajectory in the future. But there's more of a risk there. Because you're betting on the fact that the company is going to this, this stock options will be worth more than whatever your option to buy them the price that your exercise price. And then there can also be an expiration date that comes with options. So that's kind of the difference there. And then making the VAT the decision between salary versus RSU versus salary and stock option, I think is a deeply personal one. So I would make sure that you could at least pay your crack the night with the salary before you start taking hits on salary. And that's because what I you know, if you're not able to pay your bills, and like have a sustainable level of some spending, then you're probably going to go into credit card debt as well which is going to be fraught and you know, those things have a vesting period. So how long is the best thing for you is two years can you live for two years like that? You know, I mean, like what, where is that line in the sand. But if we're talking about a situation where the salary is enough to you know, pay your bills have a sustainable life for the vestment At that point, I do think it comes down to, you know, an RSP decision is a little bit easier, because you are very confident that like, you're gonna, you're kind of getting these for free, right? Like, you're you're being gifted shares after a certain vesting period, whereas the stock option is a bit more of a bet. So I think it comes down to you and how much you actually believe in the company and where it's going. And like what the what the plans are, after the vesting period, I've seen a lot of people make a lot of money off of both of those situations in the tech industry. So I'm not afraid of them at all, I just think i and i think that they can be a really good way also, to feel like you're part of something because you're, at the end of the day, what the company is worth is is a reflection of your efforts. So often, employees don't get to be that close to to it. And that's a really rare opportunity. And as an employer, that's also pretty cool that your employees didn't care that much. So at the same but at the same time, just making sure that you're not lighting yourself financially on fire in it to get those that access to those shares that are still, you know, I don't want to say a risk, but not guaranteed.

Sidney  36:04  
That makes sense. Speaking of shares, I have to ask, what are your thoughts? always laughing right now? What are your thoughts about these Wall Street but redditor? Oh, my gosh, and this year me stock? I know people that I've gotten like a couple 100 couple $1,000 on this, but like, what's your take on this as a financial coach?

Shannon  36:26  
Okay, so i think i think that there's good and bad just saying with the fire stuff. Okay. So I think that there's a good and bad thing that happened here. So the good news is that this got everybody talking about stocks, which I think is wonderful. I think that that went around the world and people are interested in trading for the first time and people that might have been nervous about it just just did it anyways, and then now are feeling that so that's a cool thing that's happened because of it. Wall Street, that's as a forum on Reddit, even before all this horrible, it is crazy. It's crazy. Also, it's like completely, you know, it's, it's like, yeah, I'll hold that opinion. But what I'm gonna say is the kinds of people that were in there were people who really had a high risk tolerance. So they have this thing called yoloing. But they felt like their life savings on one stock, and then try to treat it at these microcosms. And like these little minor minor increases, but if you have a minor increase with all of your money, you could make some money off of that, right. But that's really risky. And then people would also post their lives like last last year, like, you know, they would post later, like life savings, God, and people would break them or applaud them. And so from anybody who is new to investing, or even a seasoned vet, I would tell you, that's terrifying. Like that kind of volatility with that amount of money is never advisable, and also really scary. However, I think that I'm taking an amount of money that if it went to zero is like, okay, and throwing it into to anything, this is beyond walls, okay, and, and trying your hand at like some stocks and DIY it in a safe place where if it does go to zero, you're not going to beat yourself up. It's not a it's not your life's dream, right? I think that that is a really fun activity, I think you really learn your risk tolerance. That way, I think you understand how the stock market works in a way that it always seems, it's like fixing a carburetor in a car or taking it in library, I understand how your car works. If you fix it once, that doesn't mean that you'll never pay someone to fix your car. Again, it just means you're understanding. So you'll know what the value is, you know, the value for your dollar. So I have no problem with people investing on their own, I think it's great. But just using an amount of money that while you're learning, you know, the stakes are not that high for you. So that you don't have to like blame yourself forever. Because I've had some clients that lost a lot of money, they got caught up in the hype. And so we just, you know, it happens. And again, those emotional decisions versus those more like logical ones, like people got caught up in the message, which was a great message, which is like, Wall Street, and you can't get away with this forever and right, you know, that's great. So people wanted to vote with their dollars in that sense. So I think I think some good came from it, I really do. And I think that most people should not be you should treat it as gambling. If you're going to take that kind of like those kinds of options and betting you should treat it as gambling and therefore use an amount of money that you're cool if it goes to zero and have some fun, brave, amazing.

Kelly  39:12  
Are there any tools that you recommend that people use to help manage their finances?

Shannon  39:17  
The apps on your phone I think are very powerful. So wherever you bank are your financial institution having like, knowing where your money is and how much you have in your checking account and you're like, and what's on your credit card and stuff in real time at the drop of a dime. This is the kind of clarity that that just didn't exist even like 15 years ago, like they're you know that there's that old joke about opening bank statements like that's like not a thing. So I think that knowing what where your money is that on a month by month or paycheck to paycheck basis is huge. Because that kind of clarity you should know when when to stop and start and when you're when it's tight and when it's not. And so it just like keeps you in the know so I think even utilizing those is great. Great idea. And then I also think that I'm not a huge fan of like the budgeting apps. Really, again, no, I again, I think that I think they lead to failure. I think they for most people, I think, you know, you sit there and you put your 50 categories in, and then your app buzzes you. It's like, Hey, you overspend on coffee. And then you like, steal from parents like, and like move the money. It's such a game, it's a fraught game, you can't predict every single dollar in your life. So if you don't know what you're gonna spend on groceries next week. And so I think trying to pretend like you can set us all up to fail, and then you feel bad with money, and you quit altogether. So a lot of times those apps work wonders for certain people. So there's gonna be people listening to this, they're like, I couldn't live without this app, or whatever. And that's wonderful for you. In my experience, most of the time, with a lot of people, it's a lot of work that leads to them giving up and then feeling like, stupid. So what I usually suggest, and I do talk about this in one of my books, is like having a hard limit where one checking account or one credit card is like where you can spend money without guilt. And then the other checking account is where all of your money goes to die. And that's like your rent or your mortgage or car paying or whatever it is. And then that's a hard limit that as long as it's within that spending account, just like blow with zero guilt, who cares? I'm

Sidney  41:10  
gonna tell my boyfriend that oh my gosh, that's perfect. Because he's all about like, being on a, you need a budget and everything. And I'm just like, fuck this noise. Like, this is so confusing for me. And like, I feel like I'm in like a junior like an accountant like trying to do that. Thank you very much for that clarity. I appreciate that

Shannon  41:27  
and read worryfree. It is, that has been one of the biggest unlocking things with my clients with myself that allows that you still like be on your financial game, but without all the extra labor without the labor intensity. Perfect.

Kelly  41:42  
That's awesome. So we love to end all of our episodes, the shout outs, you can shout literally anything. What would you like to shout out?

Shannon  41:51  
I think I would like to shout out Well, hey, this podcast, which is great. I think it's important that you're talking about financial literacy, especially in the tech industry, where there are that high earning pieces, so you don't worry about it as much necessarily. So I want to shout that out. I also think that we already did it. I think that that I think that I'd shut out the Wall Street beds. Thank you for having me, because I think it just brought stocks to the forefront of the conversation in a way that it just like I just couldn't before. And I think people again, take what they want to learn from that, and then apply it realistically in their own life. So I think that that's good as well. And I think, I don't know, I just want to I just want to set up everybody in the tech industry, too. I have so many females in tech that have earned money from like stock options, or rfqs, or whatever. And that had that second career that really has opened doors for so many people like men too, but I've really seen it have big impacts on a lot of my female clients. And that's been really exciting to see as well.

Kelly  42:46  
Amazing. Sydney with your shout out this week. Yeah,

Sidney  42:48  
so since we've been talking a lot about just financial advice and things anyways, I've actually been reading this book by one of my friends on black tech, Twitter, Simone B's actually has a book on Amazon as well that it's called the financial starter kit. And she also has a coaching program where she's helping people trying to figure out what they want to do when it comes to kind of accelerating their money and figuring out like better ways to kind of like help themselves like gain multiple six figures. So the financial starter kit I really love I have been enjoying it so far. And I'm super excited to hear about your book, Shannon. I'm really like ready to read this. So I am just I'm trying to just get as much kind of in as possible when it comes to my financial resources to like help me figure out like what I need when it comes to my stuff. So yeah,

Kelly  43:39

Like what do you like about them? The one is delicious, that helps to it, they tend to lean more lighter roast and I love letter as coffee and three, they're very particular about who they actually get their beans from. So they're, you know, focusing on you know, appropriate labor and everything like that. So yeah, Love it. Love it. Love it. Okay, so last question. Where can we find you on the internet?
