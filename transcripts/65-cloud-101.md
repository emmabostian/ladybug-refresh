Ali  0:00  
You may have heard about the cloud and that what are the fluffy things in the sky have to do with computers? Well, today's episode is all about what the cloud is how you can use it and common cloud services.

Kelly  0:16  
Welcome to the ladybug podcast. I'm Kelly.

Unknown Speaker  0:18  
I'm city.

Ali  0:19  
I'm Allie.

Emma  0:20  
And I'm Emma, and we're debugging techniques. Are you developing an application with graph qL, but don't know where to start. Or maybe you're building a graph qL back end and you're overwhelmed with boilerplate code and performance problems. save yourself time and effort and check out the grand stack. The grand stack consists of four technologies that capture the best of modern web application development, graph, qL, react, Apollo, and Neo forge a database, the most widely used graph database. Together, they enable developers to build complex data intensive applications at scale with graphs all the way down by leveraging graph QL. To get started with grant stack, use the latest version of the Create grant stack app see Li and download the free Manning ebook full stack graph qL applications at Grant stack.io. Vonage is a cloud communications platform that allows developers to integrate voice video and messaging into their applications using their communication API's. Whether you're wanting to build video calls into your app, create a Facebook bot, or build applications on top of programmable phone numbers. You'll have all the tools you need. use promo code Ladybug for 10 euro of free credit when signing up at Vonage dot dev slash Ladybug. Again, that's promo code Ladybug for 10 euro a free credit.

Kelly  1:41  
So Allie, that was my favorite hook that we've ever done on this part of

Ali  1:47  
Chicago, it has been snowing so much. So I feel like I've been dealing with clouds even more than normal.

Unknown Speaker  1:53  
As to over here in St. Louis. So you're not the only one.

Kelly  1:57  
Oh, you're getting hammered with snow right now, aren't you? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:59  
so it's been snowing for like, since yesterday afternoon, and then the temperature spiked up. And so there was ice. And now it's down to like two degrees outside. And now we're gonna have another spike gradually of like temperature. So it's gonna be apparently 55 is the high on Friday, and then there's gonna be ice. There's it's gonna be super dangerous. That's like next week.

Kelly  2:26  
Yikes. I swear this is all relevant because we are talking. Yeah,

Ali  2:29  
yeah, we'll transition back into the type of cloud that we're supposed to be talking about very shortly. Okay, I'll leave it on the, the sky clouds. What do you all think of when you think of the cloud?

Unknown Speaker  2:42  
I immediately think of like AWS, I think of Jenkins cloudbees? Not that I know. Like how exactly those all work together. But DevOps definitely is a key word I guess. What about you, Kelly?

Unknown Speaker  2:58  
I,

Kelly  3:00  
I swear this is not sponsored by AWS. But that's literally what my head goes to mainly around the ideas of like EC two, and s3, because those are two that I use for my company.

Ali  3:13  
Yeah, I want to just put the disclaimer on there that I do work for AWS, I don't necessarily work on that, like heavy, heavy EC two, or s3 or anything like that I work for amplify, which is a team that focuses on front end development. So I just want to put that preface out there that I am going to know by far the most about AWS, but as compared to the other cloud providers, but

Kelly  3:40  
I mean, that's for the best because you would not know

Ali  3:44  
for sure, sure. No, in prepping for this. I was thinking all about like my early day experience with servers before the cloud was really as popular as it was now and having to SSH onto those servers and get everything installed. Oh, yeah. And do all the networking stuff that you need to actually make it so that all the things that you need it to do actually are, are accomplished. So I'm kind of glad that we've progressed to a point where some people are still using their own servers in their offices. But I think it's a little bit more rare than when I started my career at least.

Kelly  4:26  
It's also interesting watching more and more enterprise level businesses start to move on to the Cloud Library, my husband's company, which is the parent company, the New York Stock Exchange, even they're moving to the cloud now. Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  4:37  
That's so great.

Ali  4:38  
Yeah, so let's start with the definition of what the cloud is. And it's essentially on demand availability of resources. And so this allows you to instead of having to have traditional metal servers that you add another one every time your application gets to a certain point instead, you can scale, a little bit more automatically and a little bit faster. So we'll talk about the different types of cloud. And also the benefits of it versus physical servers. In this episode, we should also define the what a server is, I think just in case that's something that maybe some of our newer listeners aren't as familiar with. So servers are pretty much just computers, that provides functionality for other programs or devices. And most commonly, these handle the request response cycle. So if you go to a website, you're making a request to get some sort of information rendered on the page, then you're expecting to get a response back, which is usually that web page. And servers usually handle this, they usually give you the data that you want to display, and they handle that, that kind of process. So that's what server is. And you can use a non fancy computer for this to like, you can actually make it so that your laptops and server if you really wanted to, or a Raspberry Pi or something like that, that's not normally what they are. They're normally fancier, more heavy powered computers that don't have like monitors. But if you really wanted to, you can do that. Just whenever it turns off, then it wouldn't, your website would no longer be hosted. So

Kelly  6:22  
I still run Windows Server. Oh, my God. What?

Ali  6:29  
Oh, my goodness.

Unknown Speaker  6:30  
That's great. The blast?

Unknown Speaker  6:33  
Yeah. Do you like that? How do you like that experience?

Kelly  6:37  
Give me like 90 minutes to formulate a response. And then I'll let you.

Unknown Speaker  6:42  
Perfect.

Ali  6:43  
I think also, something that's interesting to note is that a lot of non technical people are using the cloud now too. So something like Google Drive or iCloud, aptly named, those are kind of cloud services as well, even something like Gmail, it would be classified as a software as a service, which fits under the cloud as well. So we're probably going to talk more about the cloud for deployment and servers in this episode. But note that it also applies to those other tools that you may use outside of work as well, or inside work just for a different purpose than development.

Unknown Speaker  7:23  
Yeah, definitely,

Kelly  7:24  
the water benefits of using the cloud outside of the fact that you don't have to maintain your own servers.

Ali  7:30  
I think that's a huge one. So the fact that you are having somebody else maintain those servers for you, I think that's a big benefit of another. One is that your trading capital expense for variable expense, essentially, you're paying for what your use. So if you had a month where somebody did not use your website, for some reason, your cloud bill would probably be a lot smaller. Or if you had Black Friday, or something like that, and your server load was much heavier than normal, then your bill would expand to that. So instead of having to buy a bunch of new servers, they're going to scale to where you're at. And you can scale up and down easily. And you pay for what you use like that. So that's, that's one benefit. Yeah, so you can stop guessing about capacity, so you can scale easily. So, for example, you used to see it where a lot of times if a lot of people were using a website, especially above what capacity that website normally has, it would just crash, like nobody could access it at that point. Cloud is supposed to kind of counteract that. So it's skills as you do. And it's easier to scale as well. You don't have to wait a couple months for the box that contains your servers to come in, and then set them all up and all that instead, you can just you know, click a button or whatever and get access to another server. Or you can even have it to that server load or server capacity scales as you do. That's really incredible. The tools that we're able to use so far now. Yeah, for sure, for sure. I remember having to really, and I'm sure that this is still a thing that a lot of people have to do, but like load testing websites, and essentially faking. Many people were on the site at different times, making sure that it worked with our current center. Server config.

Unknown Speaker  9:33  
Yeah, that's still what we do. Like that's it though. It just it sounds just so gross that we have to like do that stuff ourselves manually, but like, that sounds amazing. Having to do that automatically. What were you gonna say Kelly? Oh, yeah,

Kelly  9:47  
I was gonna mention that the CTO of Shopify jml. He posted on Twitter. I think it was last week that they did a they did their largest load test in Shopify history. That was four Seven minutes and 50 seconds the entirety of this year's Black Friday Cyber Monday traffic, in addition to two times the checkout was sent to just oh my

Unknown Speaker  10:07  
god. And they were able to like, there's no crashing, there was like no slowness or anything. Do you know of any? Yeah. Wow. That's incredible. That's so incredible.

Kelly  10:17  
So this is things that I love to I love to see. Because you know, the last thing a merchant wants is for the store to go down because they can't handle it and influence. Yeah,

Ali  10:27  
for sure. And that's definitely still something that most companies have to deal with. But I think we're getting to a better point where things are able to scale a little bit better than they used to.

Kelly  10:39  
Yeah, I'm going to add, if you're curious about the load testing with Shopify, they actually have a really detailed blog post on how they do performance testing on Shopify, from the Shopify engineering blog. So I'll just, I'll pop that into the show notes. If anyone's curious, or I don't

Unknown Speaker  10:55  
know, I love that I

Ali  10:56  
will have a copy of that. Other things are, you don't have to directly pay for a data center. So traditionally, larger companies would have these physical data centers with servers in them. And you'd have to pay people to work at those data centers, you'd have to pay for the building itself. And so that's a little bit or it's a lot bit expensive. So something to think about. A bit expensive. I definitely could not pay for my own data warehouse,

Kelly  11:24  
maybe one day, not that I need one,

Unknown Speaker  11:27  
I hope that I don't need one. But we'll see.

Kelly  11:32  
My my, my life and career must have taken an entire left turn, if I decide that I need to buy a DVD

Unknown Speaker  11:40  
be pretty funny, though. We're gonna

Ali  11:43  
need a warehouse.

Kelly  11:45  
The year is 2014. I'm gonna come back and just be like, hey, so funny story. Remember that time I joked about buying a data warehouse,

Ali  11:51  
I think almost the cloud analogy, or cloud computing is a good thing to talk about for the podcast, like, we use a service that hosts all of our episodes for us, we don't have to worry about all that infrastructure hosting the episodes or creating an RSS feed for it, we use a cloud service that does this for us. it circulates our episodes to different providers and generates our RSS feed for us. And we don't really have to worry that people are going to be able to listen to our episodes, if too many people are trying to listen at a time or anything like that, like that's an example of a cloud service working the way that we want it to.

Kelly  12:31  
I feel like there are so many cloud services that I used in my life that I just never really gave much thought to the fact that they are a cloud service. Oh, yeah. Because I've never been the type to be like, yeah, I totally understand cloud computing and how it works. And yeah, yeah. And I love

Unknown Speaker  12:48  
that we're able to like now it feels like that we're using it so much that you know, just with the example for the episodes, for the podcast, like we're able to go global in minutes, we're able to have as many people listen to it as possible with just like a click of a button. And that's, that's really incredible. That's just, I'm still kind of like my jaws on the floor with like, so many things that like we're able to do with this. We really don't think about it as much as we like, probably should.

Ali  13:19  
Yeah, yeah, I was reading a bunch of articles to prep for the recording of this episode. And some of them went to as far as to say that, like anything hosted on the internet was a cloud service, which I think falls under some definitions for sure. But it's a it's a broad definition. For sure. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:38  
So yeah,

Ali  13:39  
I mean, you can think of it like, you don't have to think about the infrastructure for hosting your tweets. Twitter does that that's kind of a cloud provider in some ways, but awesome. And you mentioned another one of these benefits that we haven't mentioned yet. And that's the ability to go global in minutes. So instead of having to construct data centers all over the world, so that people all over the world can access your product and have quick load times and things like that. Instead, it's much more easy to do that using a cloud provider. But

Unknown Speaker  14:09  
I'm wondering, like how long a process that might take to like, say, for instance, like Facebook, for example, your billions of people like having to, like use this all over the globe. Like, I wonder what that process takes to actually like, be able to go from these like physical servers to these cloud servers and like having to go through the process of like, not even having to, like go to these like distribution centers anymore. Is there? I don't know if you know this, but I'm wondering if there's like a huge difference in like that timing to do that.

Ali  14:39  
Oh, like how long it takes to migrate from a physical data center to the cloud. Yeah, yes. There's a lot of different stories of people doing that a lot of case study is we can definitely link some in the show notes, but it's gonna really be super variable on the size of the company. what's already What's our They're already using, hmm, and what types of things they need, and also how specialized the services that they're using are, that's going to make it easier or more simple to migrate to the cloud. Like thinking about it if I had one of my side projects, and I for some reason was like hosting that on my laptop as a server or something like wild like that, I bought myself a server and was supposed to my personal sites off of that, it'd be really, really probably take me like an hour to move that to the cloud, instead of having it on a physical server. In fact, getting it set up on a physical server would most likely take much, much more time. But if I am somebody who has my own data center with 1000s of servers in it, and super customized software running on those servers, and all that, it's going to take me much, much more time. And it's gonna take time for the engineers to learn as well. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  15:59  
so it would kind of for our listeners out there, it sounds like it would be a good idea to potentially get like certified for becoming a cloud practitioner, especially with how much like, I don't know, I'm seeing these salaries, they're definitely like in the six figures, of course, like, depending on like, what type of certifications that you get, but it's in demand, and you're definitely going to be better off, especially since like, people are going away from so many like physical servers.

Ali  16:28  
Yeah, for sure. For sure, I think that that's a good point to make is that being a cloud architect, or a cloud engineer is almost a career in and of itself. Like, there are a lot of career cloud services that are really nice to know, as a web developer, and that help us do our jobs faster. But this is an entire career track in and of itself. And so a lot of developer careers, I would say that the certifications that you see online, maybe are not the most universal. I don't know, Kelly, in Sydney, do you have thoughts on that, like the web developer certifications that you see, there?

Unknown Speaker  17:05  
They're pretty general, I feel like I mean, the only one that I really know of that's kind of legit is Free Code Camp and like, and there's so many, like, there's 1000s of people that actually use that and everything. So that's, that's truly the only one that I know of. That's like the thing to get. But I think that they're even kind of like going towards like trying to do cloud services or something. So that's, that's the only one that I can think about top of my head, but they're there. They have like so many things to kind of explore, like, say, for example, with Free Code Camp. And there's not really a concentrated thing with that. But I'm assuming that AWS does, I'm assuming that like Azure does. I'm there's there's a bunch that I just don't know about that I haven't decided to explore. So I'm sure that there's very, like, narrow kind of focus with that.

Ali  17:54  
Yeah, there's been, I think, cycles of different certifications being a big deal and web development. But I feel like I would not necessarily personally go to get a web developer certification. I don't know, that might just be a personal thing. But

Kelly  18:14  
I was gonna say, my personal spicy take, is that all those sort of things? Yeah. But I don't I just don't see the actual certification itself being of use, because we're in a field that's so quickly evolving, that as soon as you get that certification, there is something else that's not included in that whole program that you just went through, that you now have to learn to continuously update. So that's, that's why I'm not big on the

Ali  18:45  
Yes. So all plus one on that for the web developer certifications, for sure. That's kind of what I was trying to say. But I was hedging it a little bit more. Know, for some reason, I'm not as I've been on some other shows, but I will say that for all the cloud stuff. All the are many of the cloud providers have certifications. And if you're interested in becoming like a cloud architect or a cloud engineer, these things are actually really really valuable. And people do look for them on your resume people invest in these and study for them and all that so

Kelly  19:23  
yeah, I think it's like very content specific. Yeah. And is applicable to your your job and everything. I feel like that's like a totally different kind of scenario. Like you know, if you wanted to get your A plus sort of grant for grant, that's a that's a really great one to get, or any any of the network, a networking certifications. I think it's just mainly like the web development ones that I'm just like,

Ali  19:47  
Yeah, no, I very much agree with that is that certain sub fields, they're really, really valuable in certain sub fields. They're not, I would say web development, which is most of our like kind of sub field. It's probably not super valuable, but the Cloud ones I would say are really valuable if you have the ability to study for them and get through them and things like that they're definitely difficult to. So that's a that's a good point is that if you're looking into getting into this as your career path or as a sub career, then those are probably great things to at least study for, if not fully take. And you also mentioned that cloud is a really innovative and high paying career field. I feel like now that I have AWS in my resume, it's like wild, the number that people put on jobs when they reach out to me instead of before, I'm like, not really much has changed. But having that on your resume does go a long way.

Unknown Speaker  20:47  
So are you certified like in any of the AWS is at all

Ali  20:51  
I am not? No, I just

said, it is something that I have looked into. So we have access to a cloud guru through work, which is such a great platform, if you are interested in getting certified or learning more about the cloud or anything along those lines, it would be a really great thing to invest in as a course platform, really, really high quality, their stuff is really, really great. And they have they have courses on prepping for every single one of those certifications. So you can watch those. And so I've done some of those courses. I did that kind of as part of my onboarding where I wanted to learn more about AWS more generally. So I would highly recommend, okay, we've gone a little bit off track, but I think that was a good conversation to have.

Kelly  21:56  
Building full stack applications can sometimes be overwhelming, but so many different technologies to think about. live streams are a great way to see how the pieces fit together by joining other developers as they build applications from scratch. The neo 4g live stream features developers building applications with technologies like graph qL, react, view, graph algorithms, Gatsby, next js, go Lang, TypeScript, data visualization, and much more. You'll see how a graph database fits into modern development workflows, and how other developers tackle problems like authorization, cloud deployments, data import, and analytics, covering how to use the technologies needed to build and deploy full stack applications. Follow neo 4g on Twitch or YouTube to join the regular neo 4g live streams focus on building full stack applications in graph data science. So I know, cloud computing is a general umbrella term that, you know, encompasses a lot of things. So when we're talking like different types of cloud computing, can you go through like the different types that exist?

Ali  23:06  
Yeah, so the first one is infrastructure as a service. And this is like data centers, servers, storage, things like that. So that's the first one. Then the next one is platform as a service, which is more like hosted operating systems or database tooling, things like that. Then there is software as a service, which we may have heard of before, which is more like cloud hosted apps and Google Drive, things like that. And then there are Functions as a Service, which is what is commonly referred to as serverless, something that I have a lot of fun using. So those are kind of the general categories of cloud computing, I would say,

Kelly  23:43  
I think to provide some more examples around each of them could be helpful. So I pulled these from a website. So Infrastructure as a Service might be easy to as we've mentioned earlier, Rackspace, Digital Ocean is an example of infrastructure as a service. I'll skip the e commerce related ones, because those only matter to me platform as a service. So we use Heroku. That is an example of that. There's Elastic Beanstalk, which I actually don't have any kind of experience with, but I've come across the name a lot. And then Azure is also it's mostly used as a platform as a service apparently. And then we're very familiar with software as a service, things like Dropbox and Salesforce and slack and any kind of like customer service thing like Zendesk or gorgeous or there are a lot of our podcasting system service that we use. Shopify is a software as a service. So that's I think we've we definitely know these but when it comes to function as a service, this is all you

Unknown Speaker  24:55  
and is there like any sort of degree of like security that kind of comes with some of Like infrastructures when it comes to cloud computing, like, Is there like, there are it sounds like there could be more like servers that are like private public? Or are there any kind of like in between there that can be like a little bit of both and whatnot?

Ali  25:13  
Yeah. So I think security is an important thing to think about. And when it comes to cloud, there's kind of this hybrid approach where it's part on the cloud provider to make sure that their side of it is secure. But it's also half on your side, as a developer, to make sure that you're configuring things to actually be secure and the way that it needs to be. So like, if you are hosting an app in the cloud, you still need to worry about all of the application security things that you have historically done, and make sure that you have the right levels of permissions on things and things like that. But then the cloud providers, usually the one who thinks about the cloud side of the security, if that makes sense. Did that answer your question. That makes sense. Yeah, that definitely makes sense to me.

Kelly  26:02  
Can you talk a little bit more about the function as a service like serverless? Yeah,

Ali  26:07  
so if you've heard of things like AWS lambda that's been really hot, the last couple years are like the serverless framework, I think there's even netlify functions and all these other types of functions. So they call themselves serverless. Behind the scenes, there is a server, it's just you don't have to worry about it. So you can write a code or code for a function and deploy it without having to worry about any of the server things that you would normally have to worry about. It's really, really nice. It's so quick. Like, for example, I've been working on a flask app. So flask is a Python web server. And I've been essentially making it so that you can just deploy this flask app with nothing else, like you just have this flask app and run one command, and it deploys. So you don't have to think about any of the config or installation or anything like that. It just gets uploaded, and it's out there. It's almost like, you know, you use something like natla phi or I work on AWS amplify, which has a friend deployment system or service where you just push something to GitHub, and the website is deployed. It's like, as easy as that. serverless is kind of the same thing. But for back end, I would say, Oh, that makes so much more sense. Okay, that makes no more sense. So all that is that managed for you, it is so nice. And then it skills. So you get charged per request that is made, instead of how many servers you're using up or anything like that, the entire server process is kind of abstracted from you.

Unknown Speaker  27:55  
I see. So

Ali  27:57  
a lot of times, it's gonna be really affordable, because you get charged if you know, 10 people use it, you get charged for those 10 people making requests to your server list function, right? Whereas if you know a million people do, then you get charged for that.

Unknown Speaker  28:12  
Right? That's fascinating. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for describing that.

Ali  28:18  
Yeah, for sure. It's like a different paradigm. If you've been writing backend code for a while, it does look very different. But once you get used to it, it's so powerful. And it's so cool to see how fast you can kind of build with serverless.

Unknown Speaker  28:35  
Like, what are some of the kind of bigger cloud providers that are out there?

Ali  28:42  
Yeah. So again, we've been talking about how we can have different definitions of the cloud, like, are we talking about software as a service or what else? But I think the biggest ones that you probably think of AWS, which is Amazon Web Services, Microsoft has asier. And then there's Google Cloud Platform. So those are the ones that I think of right away. But there are definitely kind of an infinite number of them out there. Oracle Cloud and this other one, IBM cloud has this one as well. IBM. Yeah, there are so many we could probably spend all day listing them off, like heroes.

Kelly  29:20  
What interesting.

Unknown Speaker  29:23  
Now, since you're the expert here alley, so it seems like a lot more people have been kind of going towards like trying to get like AWS certifications, I feel like especially like around my kind of Twitter, sphere and everything. So how do you like get started with Amazon Web Services? I'm just gonna kind of throw that question to you since you work at AWS, you know?

Ali  29:49  
Yeah, that's a great question. So the first thing to do is create an account. So like a lot of software, you end up making one and then you can play around in the sandbox. There, one thing that I would say to immediately do is when you create that account, you're going to be asked to input a credit card for billing, there is a free tier for the first year. So each different service has a different free tier. So you can use a certain amount of cloud space or a certain number of requests, depending on what that service does. So make sure to pay attention to that and see what the free tier is for the service that you're using.

Kelly  30:28  
Nobody likes a surprise bill.

Ali  30:30  
Yeah, nobody likes a surprise bill. Other things that you can do is set up a billing alarm. So if you go over a certain number of requests, or if you are about to be charged over a certain amount, you get an email right away that says that. You are

Kelly  30:45  
your alarm has Yeah, your limits been raised. Like that. I love this feature. I have it turned on for Well, I have it turned on for s3, just for fun, because I don't like I use s3 for storage. Like I have all of my travel pictures backed up there for maybe like all the years and some of the things, whatever. But I get like the monthly alert that my billing alarm is triggered. And it's like, oh, you're paying $5.14 this month. Because

Ali  31:18  
I love it. My AWS account is a magic or is managed by AWS, as you might imagine, I don't necessarily have to pay for my services myself since I do work for them. But I do still have like billing alerts set up just so that I can kind of relate to customers and see how much they might be paying. And I have like 25 apps built on amplify, which is a service that I work on. And my bill every month is like 20 cents. It's It's wild how you're using these apps, right? Like they're just my like, toy using just spin things I but it's still kind of amazing to me each month when I see that that bill, I'm like that's that's not that I can pay that.

Unknown Speaker  32:01  
Yeah.

Ali  32:02  
expense all this like I would be okay with it.

Unknown Speaker  32:06  
You're making me wonder if I should like just start playing with amplify now just to like, see how that goes. I'm sure that like if I decided to have any like traffic on a website, it'd be definitely I'd be paying more than 20 cents. But I like this. I like this very, like, price kind of service. So

Ali  32:23  
yeah, yeah, we can talk a little bit more about apple pie in a minute to just because it kind of fits under this. And it's fun. I like it. I work with it all day every day.

Kelly  32:33  
I like it.

Unknown Speaker  32:36  
I don't want to play

Unknown Speaker  32:39  
by here.

Ali  32:39  
Yeah. Okay, so we were going to talk about some of the services that are on AWS, just because they're, you know, examples of the different things that you can do. And oh, let's talk about what a service is. So all the I mean, I think it's kind of what it sounds like. But essentially, the different categories of things that you would want to do are put under services. So if you want a database, that would be an AWS service, or if you want to do like static files cert, hosting, that would be another AWS service. Or if you wanted to host a Django app that would fall under a different type of AWS service. There's also like ones for AI and machine learning and all these like fancy things that are out of my paygrade. Do you know how many there are? Oh, my goodness, that's a great question. It's like, it's always expanding to. So I probably need the number before reinvent. But then like more launch every year at our big conference, which is read reinvent.

Kelly  33:36  
The AWS website just says over 200

Ali  33:41  
over 230 sorted says, so it's probably somewhere around there

Kelly  33:45  
at the beginning of 2020 the count was 191

Unknown Speaker  33:50  
Whoa, wow.

Kelly  33:51  
Yeah. And and so any night Wow, that was 169. So

Ali  33:59  
there's a lot of different services.

Kelly  34:01  
I like imagine like part of the onboarding exam for getting like, I like totally do this just to just to screw with people's like, all right, so you're, you're officially done with your first week as an employee at AWS, please list all of the services in alphabetical order from memory. I know

Ali  34:25  
I think this comes down to one of those conversations that we have on here all the time, like you don't need to know everything, I very much do not know every AWS service that I worked for them. And I mean, I worked on one service of pretty much all the time is my job. So that's that's something to note is that even AWS engineers do not know all the services so focus on the ones that you need, don't necessarily rabbit hole into having to know everything about everything cuz there's no need. I mean, unless there is a need for you for some reason. Okay, so we talked a little bit about amplify. So amplify is a suite of tools specifically for front end and mobile developers. So I think historically, people have thought of AWS more for back end engineers. And we're focused completely on making things more accessible and easier to use for front end developers. So things like static site hosting, we have a tool that builds static sites, and deploys them and hosts them and all that. So you can add a custom domain and all those types of things added, like the pull requests, previews, and all those fun things that you can do. So that's amplify hosting. We also have the amplify ci, which allows you to add services through a command line interface, things like storage, or lambda functions, or any of these things, you can add through the amplify CLA. And then we also have the admin UI, which has been my pet project recently, I really obsessed with it. And it allows you to build a back end in clicks and add authentication and a few more clicks as well. So you don't even need to really write much code for that. So

Unknown Speaker  36:10  
pretty fun, very intriguing. Yeah, cool.

Ali  36:13  
So that's amplify, which is the product that I work on. So I feel like I get so excited just talking about it. Because it's

Kelly  36:19  
cool, I can tell there is there is actual excitement in your voice when you talk about it.

Unknown Speaker  36:23  
Like choosing right now your teeth like bright and shining cheeks, just like it's hilarious. It's great. But I'm glad that you love what you're doing.

Ali  36:33  
Yeah, for sure. It's really fun to work on something that's so developer focused, like this is my first time working on something that other developers get to build things with. And I think that as a developer, myself, there's something really cool about that, instead of thinking about end users, I'm thinking about, like, other versions of myself, and people like me, so I think that's really cool. Really fun. Um, so other services that you may have heard of, or may want to use in the future would be EC two, which is a virtual server in the cloud, is kind of more of probably traditionally what you would think of, if you were thinking of cloud services. And so it's going to make it so that you can obtain new servers in minutes instead of weeks or months or whatever.

Kelly  37:23  
I booted up an easy to server, running Windows. So I can test on like a Windows machine. When I was doing like cross browser and device testing, but super smart.

Ali  37:36  
You can have different types of servers on there. So you can have like a Linux server, you could have a Windows Server, or you can do max now to I don't know as much about that. But I know you can have a Mac easy to instance now. So that's interesting thing. So yeah, yeah, I think that was released at reinvent. s3 was my first ever service, and I believe Yep. Now to this URL for static file hosting. So essentially files that aren't going to change a lot things like images for your site, or videos, or I've done like audio files, it's almost like a series of folders in the cloud that you can host files on, it's

Kelly  38:19  
really cool too, because you can you can change the permissions in terms of visibility. So like, everything can be super locked down, for example, for like my travel photos, nobody needs to come across those. But we actually use s3, to upload files that we submit from forms like a like a merchant, we'll upload like import a CSV, for example, it uploads to s3, we load it from s3, pull the data from it, and then we can remove it from s3 once we're done. Oh, really cool, though, that in that sense, of course, you have to change the permissions a little bit around to allow for certain access to it. But it's, and then of course, you can literally have full access full public access to these files as well. So yeah, and like

Unknown Speaker  39:00  
for this kind of example that you gave Kelly, like, are the users able to kind of like, modify those permissions, like once they upload their files? Or is it like kind of on your end, where you have to kind of like exchange, um, kind of like privacy

Kelly  39:19  
on our end, usually, because we're the one who's setting it up. But I mean, if they set up their own account, then of course, they can go in and change that as well.

Unknown Speaker  39:26  
Okay, if that makes sense. Yeah, go

Ali  39:28  
a couple of examples of things that I've done with s3 as well, or like early in my career, I had a bunch of CSV files that were programmatically generated from an application, and those would get uploaded to s3 once they were created. So those csvs weren't going to change a bunch so they were kind of safe to put on there. I've also worked for dev two, they use it for storing all the images that go into people's posts. So you upload your images to s3 when you upload them. For a blog post or whatever, and then they get hosted on there. Recently, I've been using it to build a video course platform. So I've been building that for myself and all the videos are hosted on s3. So that's a very handy one. And it's not very difficult to use now. You can either use it through amplify, or you can use it through the AWS SDK. And both ways are not very difficult. It's like a couple lines of code.

Kelly  40:27  
Yeah, yeah. They're definitely something worth checking guys to know.

Ali  40:31  
Yeah, yeah. Good developer things to know. Elastic Beanstalk is another one that is used for like application hosting. And then serverless, lambda functions. And this is kind of my favorite right now.

It's so cool that you can not worry about the server. You know what I mean? Like, it's just, it's nice. I don't know, too much of my life has been spent on servers and server config.

Unknown Speaker  41:12  
Are you sure that you're done with it? No,

Ali  41:14  
probably not. I'm definitely not actually done with it. But I've been having a ton of fun with creating lambda functions. Another business use case of this that I've used these for recently, are responding to a stripe web hook. So with stripe, you can make it so that whenever somebody pays for something, it triggers a web hook, and then does some sort of logic in your application. So for me, I'm building this video course platform. And so I'm making it so that once the person signs up for the course, there's a lambda function, and it gives that user permissions to access that course.

Kelly  41:53  
That's the thing. I love working with books just in general. Yeah, I'm doing a lot with with Shopify with one of our tech partners recharge which powers subscriptions. Yeah, that's, that's okay. That's an interesting, that's an interesting use case, something I can actually relate to. I'm

Ali  42:12  
deaf to most of their code is open source. But there are certain parts of the algorithms that they want to keep a little bit behind closed doors to an extent just, you know, like the homepage algorithm and things like that. And so they've hosted that code in a serverless function. So that triggers when needed. But yeah, I've been using these a lot from my business logic with an application. So anything that I would normally put in like a back end server, I've been using server lists for instead, building something like a flask app that queries for data in a database or something like that. They're even serverless databases to, which allows you to create a database and configure it and have it hosted and all that without needing to worry about the server very much. So Dynamo DB is the serverless database. I've been using a lot

Kelly  43:03  
about any kind of like resources or people to follow who are big enough?

Ali  43:09  
Yeah, so that is a really great question. A cloud guru, again, is where I go for most things. But there are also some really great books like O'Reilly books, it's like 97, things that cloud developers should know, or something like that. And that's going to be the book that we give away for this episode.

Kelly  43:29  
I don't know if this is actually a good resource. But when we are talking about books to give away, I came across a book that was called explain the cloud, like I'm 10. And I'm definitely going to put this in the in the show notes just because it's like cute illustrations and stuff. So I'm a sucker for learning. Like I'm 10.

Ali  43:48  
I'll also put my some of my co workers as links in the resources as well, because following them online would help you know a little bit more about amplify or about AWS. AWS also has this program called the heroes. And so it's people who are creating AWS content and putting it out in the wild. And it's really, really high quality content. So I'll link a directory to them as well. And Google has something similar as well for Google Developer experts. So we can link to that directory as well.

Kelly  44:20  
Awesome. Nice. That's so cool. Well, I think that was a good that was a good kind of introduction to cloud computing.

Unknown Speaker  44:30  
Yeah, definitely. Kelly, how about your shout out? Ooh,

Kelly  44:36  
shout out. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  44:38  
Yes. So

Kelly  44:39  
I am going to shout out company called the CIL I may have talked about this in the past before but but plant company, plant company, I have this desk next to me all the time, and I'm constantly reminded of the Really great shopping experience they had on their site, and I am a new plant mom. So I'd like their resources that they have and helping you like pick out which plants are actually going to be best for you based on where you live and your ability to keep things alive. So yeah, this is this is

Unknown Speaker  45:20  
I need to go back on their

Kelly  45:22  
alley, what's yours? facilis pretty fun.

Ali  45:24  
My is ring fit, which is a really funny one. So I got a Nintendo Switch for Christmas, which is very exciting. I can play Animal Crossing and all the fun things on it. But there's also this game ring fit, and there's like this massive ring, and you work out with it. And it's very fun. The game is very engaging, but it's also a really good workout. So I would recommend it's pretty fun. Oh, yeah. Cindy, How

Unknown Speaker  45:52  
about yours. Okay, so I am going to do another shameless plug. Because it has officially been a year since I became a Java software engineer. So I was a QA for a year. And then I was Java software engineer. So congratulations to me. And I made a YouTube video about it. So go to my YouTube channel and go see the lessons that I've learned. And my first year as a software engineer, so yay,

Kelly  46:24  
that's I love it. Shout out. Yay.

Ali  46:31

We'll select one tweeter to win a copy of 97 things every cloud engineer should know by Emily Freeman and Nathan Harvey this week, We post new episodes every Monday, so make sure to subscribe to be notified and leave a review. We also have a YouTube channel. So if you want to watch our videos on there, that would be awesome, too.

Unknown Speaker  46:54  
Yeah, super excited about that. I'm very glad that like our kind of subscriber and kind of user count are growing on that. So we're getting over what is that archive of like videos kind of together. So make sure you guys stay tuned with that very excited about it. And I believe that this is the week that we can finally like convert our name to like

Unknown Speaker  47:14  
I was just watch See ya slash Ladybug podcast. I'm fairly sure that today's the week where we can do that. So no

Kelly  47:21  
longer lying about our username.

Unknown Speaker  47:28  
Yeah, so I'll be doing that today. So yeah,

Kelly  47:30  
super excited. All right. Well, thanks for tuning in. And we'll be back in your earholes again next week. Bye, guys.
