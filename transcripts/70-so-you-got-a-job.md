Sidney  1:36  
So welcome everybody. And hello ladies. How are you this fine Monday morning at 9am. Central Time confused I noticed the hen it was in Kelly's and it's about three where you are Emma.

Emma  1:49  
It's four here. We actually just switched the clocks on Sunday. Yeah. Oh,

Sidney  1:56  
that's different. That's interesting. I wish that would stop but yeah, it's fine. Oh, Hi. How are you guys? Ah, it's so good to see everybody this morning I see that the comments are just kind of like going kind of bonkers right now. So we'll be kind of checking in with you guys at some of your questions later on at the end of this but today we are talking about you got a job so now what there are a couple of things that we think would be really good to share with you guys but I really want to know like I just feel like with the experience of like having that first offer was just very I just surreal I guess I don't know about like you mo for like Spotify since that was your dream job or with you alley with AWS? Like, what was that feeling? Like for you guys? When you like Got that? Like when they said yes, we want you like, let's go. Let's do this.

Emma  2:47  
Um, so I actually didn't ever negotiate a job offer ever until Spotify gave me an Well, it's not great. Actually, I think you should always negotiate up until a certain point. And actually women are less likely to negotiate salaries. So yeah, it is we could, we should do a whole episode about salary negotiation. But when I got an offer from Spotify, I did try to negotiate and I have a couple of tips I can mention in a second. But they actually what I loved, they gave me the best offer they possibly could straight out of the gate. They didn't even try to like force me to negotiate, which I appreciated.

Kelly  3:23  
Oh, I see. That's how I actually handle it at the tap room. I set everything fixed salary, this is exactly what you're going to be getting paid. Everyone gets the same benefits. I mean, we have unlimited vacation, plus, you know, 20 minimum days or whatever. There's not much to negotiate. But my my goal there is to take the pressure off of having to negotiate and let you focus on everything else that comes with getting a new job. So that was a very intentional move that I made.

Sidney  3:50  
Yeah, actually like doing the job and like having people focus on actually wanting to like transition into a pretty smoothly. That's really great. That's, that's really great that the taproom is doing it. What about you, Allie? How about you with that?

Ali  4:02  
I did not negotiate for my first job. I tried to and they were just like, no, like, no. But the last couple of jobs I have general assembly was also I think like Kelly and Spotify where they give you what they can off out the gate, which is not not the best anyways, um, but it's good that they do give you what they can. When they do, even though that's probably not a market offer, and then with AWS. I did negotiate and so that's that's where I am.

Sidney  4:42  
That's really interesting. Like I've had a complete like opposite. Like when it came to my first job. It was just like, here's the number they like, told me off the bat like what the number was and I was like there's no like, No, I can't do that. Like what can you do to kind of like close the gap for me. Because like, this is what I'm looking for. And that that didn't take very long for them to be like, okay, we want you to just like take the money and like leave. So just go. And that I don't know, like, you guys have had different experiences. I'm really grateful for mine. And I know that in other positions that I've had that are not tech related, I've definitely like not negotiate she ated my salary. But I think that we should at least like give our audience here some tips on how we should actually negotiate. And so, Emma, do you want to talk about some points that you have first? Yeah,

Emma  5:33  
definitely. So before you do negotiate, first of all, you need to do your research, I find that a lot of candidates, from what I've seen, and from what people have said, a lot of candidates try to negotiate for the hell of negotiating and they don't actually do their market research. So you need to to do some research to say how much is your position paid on average, fair geographic location and given like the job requirements? That's like Glassdoor is a really great website to check related salaries for your job role. But yeah, you need to have like some semblance of an idea of like, what you should be expecting to receive. And really, it's all about why do you deserve this like so when I wrote mine negotiation and letter it was all about like, I am really excited to work with the team, you know, I really hope I can join you. Given you know, all of these things, I listed out some of the contributions that I make, given you know, that I'm a heavy contributor, and I make, you know, courses and I'm essentially acting as a representative of Spotify to the community through my work. I'm looking for something in this range or around this number. What do you think and, and just remember, like, your recruiter wants to help you but they do have constraints. And so you need to recognize this. And make it clear that you really do want the job Don't Don't say like, oh, if you don't give me this, I'm gone no ultimatums. If you give them an ultimatum, there's they're probably going to rescind an offer which I've never had happen, but I have heard horror stories. So so just I would just suggest if you're going to negotiate do some research about how to negotiate effectively, I think the Harvard Business Review has a great article. And just you know, have someone that you trust professionally read through it, make sure like or use grammerly if you don't trust someone not to spill, the fact that you got a new job offer use Grammarly the paid feature, they have a Tone Analyzer that can analyze your tone. So make sure making sure it's not aggressive or anything.

Kelly  7:31  
I will say with one caveat. Okay. Always don't give ultimatums. But I also see if you negotiate, and it's completely reasonable. And that company rescinds, the job offer I consider that a blessing in disguise, because that's generally a red flag if the if the company's work environment. Exactly, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  7:54  
That's a lot to have to deal with. Yeah,

Emma  7:56  
there's a question on the chat I'm seeing and for those listening on a podcast app, this is our last episode of the season. So is live on video, which is wonderful. So the question is, do you think geographic location has a role in salary negotiation for a remote role? Absolutely, it does. If you're going to be working remotely. It's kind of up to the company to determine whether or not they want to provide the same level of salary across all similar roles in the company, or if they want to base it off geographic locations. So just make sure that you're aware of that.

Kelly  8:27  
Yeah, it definitely varies from from company to company, how they how they want to handle that, I have mixed feelings about offering a lower salary just because somebody happens to be living, let's say, in Nebraska, I don't know what the going rate is in Nebraska. So I'm just throwing out a random state. But I have mixed feelings about it. Because you shouldn't be penalized for living in a low cost of living area either.

Sidney  8:52  
I love how some of these companies are starting to make sure that their rate is kind of constant depending on like your geographical location. Now that it's basically like, kind of standard that we're working from home now. So definitely make sure that you guys do your research, because you never know like what you can negotiate, especially if it's not necessarily the monetary value that they're able to give you. Maybe they're able to do something else when it comes to negotiating some of your benefits. Like how many days potentially that you get off? Or if there is, I don't know, like something about potentially like insurance policies, whether or not you're able to work from home whether or not you can negotiate for that. negotiating for like a stipend or something for like office supplies. Like if you're working from home, like is it okay that I can like buy a desk on the company's card, like there are different things that you guys can negotiate. That's not just money. So make sure that you guys are aware of that.

Kelly  9:46  
It's a really important point. And actually, I was going to mention Wesley in the comments actually commented on that exact thing.

Emma  9:51  
Real quick, though about negotiating paid time off. This might just be an American. Like benefit. In terms of negotiating, because I believe in Germany and Sweden, our vacation days are set by the government. So I wouldn't necessarily say we can negotiate paid time off in Europe, but I'm not positive. I just believe that that is true. But equity is a great thing to be able to negotiate or, or working hours if you can't negotiate PTO.

Ali  10:21  
Yeah. And to build off of that, I would say that a lot of very large companies aren't going to be able to change that either. It's just set universally across the board. But in my experience, most startups are able to, but they're usually less likely to negotiate on salary, because usually they don't have much

Kelly  10:39  
startup for Yeah. Back. Please go easy on us bootstrap startups that don't have, you know, those millions of dollars in the bank account to pay top tier

Ali  10:50  
salaries? Yeah, for sure. For sure. So depending on the job, it's gonna be different, what you can actually negotiate and very meaningfully to.

Sidney  10:59  
That makes sense. That makes sense. Yeah, I think that is there any other things that we want to talk about when it comes to the salaries and like negotiations and things? Oh, Julieta says in Germany that vacation days are by law two days per month, so at least 24 days a year in some companies, up to about 30. So Oh, that's really interesting. Like, you can take Also, you can take one or two days off if you're sick with Oh, climb. That's very, that's very nice. I would love that. Yeah. Cuz I feel like very nervous about like having to take sick days. And I think that that's just like a very American thing, where it's like, make sure that you keep working, make sure that you do that. And American.

Kelly  11:43  
It absolutely isn't American, and also taking mental health days. Oh, my God.

Sidney  11:48  
Yeah, just, that's a lot. So make sure you guys are again, doing your research on it. Because you never know what you can negotiate, there are going to be limits. But

Unknown Speaker  11:57  
yeah,

Emma  11:58  
I'm moving on. I

Sidney  11:59  
think I now that you have gotten the job, but potentially after you've negotiate your salary, or negotiated your benefits, um, there's going to be a lot of housekeeping that I think that you guys should be making sure that you do at least like the first couple of weeks on the job, I feel like in the first two weeks, I'm very like anal about this myself. So, um, there are a couple of things that I feel like we should be doing over the course of those few weeks, especially. Because this is just going to kind of determine like, what exactly the pace that you're going to go at, when it comes to your job for like, the rest of the time. So expect to feel overwhelmed, especially like in a debt developer position, or some type of tech position, you're not going to always know what is like going on or what's like, what technologies you're going to be exclusively using, who you're going to be able to talk to you about, like different things that you might need on your team. I like the hierarchy necessarily of like, who you like your management is who you need to talk to you in HR about different things. So there's a lot to kind of go through when it comes to figuring out like, the different like nuances of your company, or just your department or just in general a whole new career. So just be mindful, expect to feel overwhelmed. And it's okay to be figuring these things out. And it's okay to be asking these questions. And I don't know, I feel like with my, when I had transitioned into a tech job, like, the first thing that I did was like, I asked one of my co workers, as long as my manager, just like I went out for a coffee with them. I went one on one, I just got some like basic, like personal questions answered about them, like, I got to know them a little bit better, and they got to know me a little bit better. And I'm sure that it's going to be different depending on whether or not somebody is going to be working from home, but getting your basic questions answered from them, and then being able to have like that kind of way to kind of slip in and like have him be your ally or friend or like a lunch buddy or something. I think that that's not a bad way to like start off your when is it transition into a new role? So

Emma  14:09  
yeah,

Ali  14:10  
yeah, I would actually go beyond that. And I would say it's just scheduled like a half an hour, one on one with every person that you think you're going to be working with directly. Because the most important thing that you can do early is to build trust and to build up relationships with these people, because you're going to eventually need them. In order to get things done or to ask questions to or in order to collaborate with them on things you're gonna get need to get their opinion. And so building up that relationship early and talking about both what they do in their job, what their role is, what their day to day looks like, but then also who they are as a person so you can sidebar them and meetings and be like, Oh, you know, how was your weekend or whatever. I think that those types of things go a really long way and building those relationships up before you have to have the More difficult conversations with them down the road is really important

Kelly  15:03  
that I definitely want to, I want to stress like this, this goes beyond those like your your co workers, anyone tangentially related to your job, like expand expand out in the company,

Emma  15:14  
I wrote a blog post called five reasons why Spotify onboarding is better than yours, which is a sassy ass title and I'm here. But um, it kind of relates to Ali's point. So when I first joined this set up a Trello board for me with different pipelines corresponding to the different weeks the first like six weeks or so that I was there or like months, and they had different tasks. And one, I had a card for every single team member. So there was a whole column with everyone's all the team members, their photos, their bios, everything about them. And then a card that said, schedule a 30 minute one on one with every single person and I had to check it off every time I did. Oh, they, they also assigned to me a buddy. So even before I joined, I was an email contact with this person. They were they attended some of my meetings with me, even if they didn't have to be there just for like, you know, emotional support. And there's some other things as well. But this was like the biggest help I actually, I've never contributed so quickly to a product before my entire life. Like when I joined IBM I struggled for a whole year, I was able to get up and running it in like two weeks, not even on my own just because of the way that they had done their onboarding. So we'll link that my blog was in the show notes.

Kelly  16:26  
We're a we're a much smaller company than Spotify, obviously. But we we intentionally pair each new new hire with somebody else that they can absolutely always go to for anything. But we make very big introductions for everyone who joins the team. So they know who everybody is. We I like to think that our developer onboarding process is pretty, pretty great as well.

Sidney  16:48  
I think that we should also kind of talk about and I feel this way, I don't know about you guys, making sure that you set your boundaries when it comes to work early. Because I feel like I don't know if there is anybody else that kind of feels the same way that it's not always important to stick around to like, after office hours or after like common work hours to like know everything in the book every single little detail and nuance that people tell you to like do. And I feel like that's also kind of

Ali  17:24  
a

Sidney  17:25  
setting like actual, like strong boundaries for like, between your work and personal life, especially if you're working from home. And setting the precedent that you're always available is not going to be good for you in the long run. Especially if you feel like this is I that you're feeling obligated because oh, like I knew I need to make sure that I'm learning everything, it's really not always going to be that important to know something and like stay on after hours just to like get that little thing. I'm sure that there are ways and processes for you to make sure that you get whatever questions that you have like answered. And so I normally set reminders throughout the workday for when I need to get my ass up. When I need to go eat lunch, when I need to go take a walk, I bought my Apple Watch recently, just to make sure that I was able to have that like, Hey, get up, I need you to get up, I need you to walk around and do like whatever, you know what I'm saying? Like, it's really important for me to set those boundaries, because I know that I will commit too much. There'll be too much stuff going on. And I feel like it's important. And it's not always important. What about you guys? What do you think about that?

Emma  18:33  
I think setting professional and personal boundaries is important. Like, I've make it very clear to my friends and family that like hey, I'm not gonna respond right away. I'm not like an instant communicator. I hate actually using my phone to communicate. So there's a good likelihood that it'll take me like two weeks to get back to you. And so I do that personally and professionally.

Ali  18:55  
Feel like a good one. Yeah, I think also, getting comfortable with your setup is so important early as well. In that like my new job at AWS, I guess it's not that new anymore. I'm seven to eight months in. But I have outlook for the first time I've always had Google Calendar and Google Gmail and all that setup. And so it was a whole new setup to get used to Outlook. It is so different and so confusing. And so I think that this links into that, that knowing how to turn off notifications at certain times or make it so that my notifications are filtered the correct way on there. So getting used to that setup I think is really important early on as well. But yeah, I agree is set those precedents as early as maybe not responding to messages outside of work hours. If you are normally somebody who takes lunch breaks do that. I feel like I just don't want to work remote because I don't know it feels lonely. To hear something. But set those precedents is early because if you don't, then you're just gonna keep doing that you're a one time working there probably Oh, one

Emma  20:10  
thing I wanted to mention it, it's not necessarily boundary related, but it is related to like getting to know your team. Sorry, I didn't mean to like steal that from Allah. I just wanted to mention before I forget. And Swedish culture, we have this concept called FECA. And basically, the idea is to get a coffee, and a pastry with someone and just talk and spend time actually, and off of your devices. And we have this scheduled for my team every day for 30 minutes in the afternoon, just to check in with each other, and not talk about work. So this can also be an idea that you bring to your team, especially if you're remote. Even if you're not remote. At some point, if we're in offices again, doing a FICO or a coffee break is really nice, especially like we did one on ones walking outside. So it was nice to social distance, but also see someone

Sidney  21:01  
that's really nice, that's a really nice concept. I feel like I'm with me, and kind of knowing that I want to work remotely a little bit more. Now that I do have like the space and kind of the mental capacity to kind of compartmentalize, like what my tasks are during the day and not have so many like active things kind of going on around me, that would be something that I would consider, like an exposition that I would get to personally get to know some people better, as well as my managers, and potentially the hierarchy that I would like, I guess, like report to and things. So that's actually a great suggestion. Thanks for that.

Emma  21:38  
One thing I want to call out. Speaking about trust and building relationships is that we have an entire episode about cross cultural collaboration. If you are working with people from all over the world, I highly recommend reading the cultural map by Erin Meyer and listening to our episode about it. Because we talked about how different cultures trust, there are two different kinds, there's effective trust and cognitive trust. I believe effective trust is like relationship based trust. Or it might be the other way around. But one is relationship based where you actually need to build bonds with your coworkers outside, on a personal level. And the other is like the ability to trust them, like their professional expertise, and like the fact that they'll actually get their stuff done. So highly recommend listening to that, especially for starting on a new team.

Ali  22:21  
Yeah, that's a good point.

Sidney  22:23  
And I think that that's also really important to make sure that not only are you trying to make sure that you build that trust, but in some spaces, I'm going to put this out there that making sure that you build that trust is incredibly important for black and brown people that are going to be coming into these offices are working remote, especially in the tech industry, I've definitely had it where I there have been experiences that I've had where like I have it tried to build bonds with like different people. And there have been different situations where I feel like either that trust was broken by me or that trust was broken by that other person. And so that kind of like sets the precedent of like different impressions that people get a view. And so it's just really important to make sure that you hit that home if you can or read that book and make sure that you check out our resources in the show notes. Definitely do so what was that book called? Sydney? I don't remember off the top of my head. I appreciate it. Thanks for calling me on that.

Emma  23:26  
Good. One thing I do to set boundaries is immediately reject any meeting invitation that comes in an inappropriate hour, be that lunch be that anytime after like five. Do y'all do that?

Sidney  23:40  
That is that is so nice. I, I have definitely hired managers where they were like, depending on like, whatever high importance, quote, unquote, that they feel like it is like they've asked me through lunch to get on a call for something that's like with production support, or just like another meeting and it's like, Are you kidding me? Like, I've ignored those before. And I've definitely gotten written up for it. I will fully admit that on here on the interwebs and I think that is incredibly inappropriate. So depending on like, what company that you're in, I just feel like that kind of culture is like really strange. But that's that's so nice to be able to just be like no, I'm not like answering this between 1201 I'm not doing this just like wait until I have that lunch hour where I'm able to just like relax and like decompress and things and then we can talk then we can go from there.

Kelly  24:36  
kind of tend to tech, tangent, unrelated but you don't really grinds my gears is when I send somebody a link to my calendly that shows my availability and they're like these times don't work for me. How about these times that are clearly blocked off on your calendar for a reason.

Emma  24:52  
You know what sucks for me is trying to fill out a calendar calendly for someone it's either like 4am, mountain time or 2am My time.

Ali  25:03  
Yeah, I think all these things are so difficult. I think, especially in this remote world, I most my team works pacific time, and I am in central time. And so a lot of times I do end up working at hours that are imperfect for me. And that's just because I kind of have that privilege of working remote. And so my time zones are staggered. And then the other,

Sidney  25:28  
I think another thing to kind of set the precedent on like building those relationships and building that trust is also reporting and knowing the reporting structure and management hierarchy. And this is going to be like a kind of a, I don't know, if it's a hot take, or like, just my opinion, or whatever,

Kelly  25:49  
I like a good spicy take.

Sidney  25:51  
But there's always going to be like the office policy and like the office drama, and you're going to need to know like, who is who, when it comes to like the different things that are going on in the structure of like management and things, you never know what's going on above your head. And it's always going to be to your advantage to make sure that you establish trust with all of your co workers, your management, people that you work, like, at least closely around, but not necessarily in your department. Or like parallel to you. Um, it's always I feel like about making sure that when people are speaking about you like in the room that you are not inside of, it's always positive. So like knowing that they're going to be office politics, wherever you are, making sure that you're not going to be exclusively like involved in anything that's like dramatic. And don't be aggressive. Like don't do that. Just, you know, I understand the need to be like, Oh my god, whisper whisper. Like it happens. We've we've all done it in some cases, but like don't make that be the precedent of like the impression that you've like or giving off. Because it's not, you don't want to be opinionated, like way too fast when it comes to the different like topics and office drama. So I just wanted to throw that out there for some people, because it's very easy to get caught up with just things like that. So don't do it.

Emma  27:11  
Can we also normalize giving direct negative feedback? Yeah. All right. Let's talk about this for a second. I mentioned we have an episode on this, go listen to this. But here's the sparknotes edition. There are two different types of feedback cultures, kind of two and a half. Direct negative feedback cultures like Germany, and a lot of countries in Europe, I would say are direct negative feedback cultures, where they will literally tell you what they mean. It's very explicit, it can kind of come off harsh depending on where your culture sits in relation to that if you're more like read between the lines or direct whatever, but they're very straight to the point. Then you've indirect negative feedback cultures that perhaps use these words, I think they're called down graders that kind of less than that below and Americans are, when I say Americans, I mean people from the United States of America, we are very great at the compliment sandwich. So sticking in a piece of constructive criticism in the middle of two positive compliments, um,

Kelly  28:11  
and then there a better way of calling the compliment sandwich as the shit sandwich. Yeah, to be clear,

Unknown Speaker  28:15  
I hate it. Oh, my God,

Ali  28:17  
but and then

Emma  28:18  
you've got Asian cultures, like India, China and Japan, where they actually omit anything bad and only explicitly state the positive. So it's your decision, or it's your responsibility to read between the lines and deduce what needs to be improved. However, when you join a new company, don't talk shit about people don't stoop to that level. Instead, if you have an issue with someone, first of all, just message them and say, Hey, I have a couple things. I'd love to chat to you about how we can collaborate better, do you have 15 2030 minutes that we can block on the calendar just to talk about this, make it a safe space. So it's non confrontational, and it is done in private? Use the template of like, Hey, here's the action that occurred. Here's how it made me feel. Here's how we could work better together moving forward. Don't gossip, use that template and listen to her episode, this has a lot more advice for you.

Kelly  29:09  
I would say the one thing I would add to that is immediacy. Don't wait to do it. Because don't wait

Sidney  29:14  
to do it. But then also, Don't put the blame out there. I think that like a big thing for like therapy is that um, don't use use statements, putting the blame exclusively on them. And don't put it in third person. It's like this situation happened. I feel that this situation happened. You're putting it in your perspective. And it's going to be their job to be able to like take that constructive criticism and constructive complimenting because there is a such thing as that. And they're going to be able to say hon like, is this something that was right about me? Is this something that had happened where I potentially like hurt people's feelings. If yes, then they're going to be much more like risk. about like, what type of changes that they can make? And if no, some people will not understand that maybe they have offended somebody in some way, and just kind of move on with their lives. It's okay to forgive people about that. Because sometimes just like, they don't realize that this is something that has hurt you hopefully, in that explanation, you've been able to kind of say, exactly like what has happened in the situation where like, it was hurtful or disrespectful and things, but it will happen, where there's going to be that like miscommunication where maybe the other person doesn't think that anything is wrong, like please don't hold that against them. It just it's different personalities, it's different type of projection degrees, and go to therapy about it, if you're super like fucked up about it.

Kelly  30:47  
And I also want to shout out the book, Crucial Conversations I highly, highly, highly, highly recommend every single person reads this book, it applies not only to work, but to just difficult conversations you have to have in your everyday life as well as relationships with anybody. I yeah, look, we'll include a link to it in the show notes, look it up Crucial Conversations. That's what it's called, highly recommend. Well,

Ali  31:08  
I also want to say real quick that something you should really be thoughtful about when coming into a new team is that you don't have all the context you don't know all the reasons for decisions. And so if you are coming in and are really, really opinionated, right out the gate on everything, and are wanting to change absolutely everything day one, don't take a step back, listen for a while be somebody who tries to learn from the other people at your workplace learns the context for things that learn why certain decisions were made certain ways, learn why things are the way that they are, and then earn trust with your co workers so that when you do want to change something down the road, you have that built up, because a lot of times if you're just like, we need to change x, y, and z, because they're awful right now, you're like insulting all the people who have been working on that team already who have built X, Y, and Z for all these reasons that you probably don't know of yet. And so, take a step back. Listen, be humble at first, don't think that you're just coming in and like going to change everything right off the bat.

Kelly  32:17  
Just don't try to bulldoze

Ali  32:19  
doors like I've noticed this so often with people?

Emma  32:25  
I did, I did that a little bit in my current role where someone had to be like, you need to pick your battles. And I was like, you're right, I do. I've been picking too many of them. One thing I want to positively call out is that my coworker is listening Charlotte Gore. And she made it she made a comment about the feedback. And she said, The trick is to focus on behaviors, which people can change and not personality, which they can't. So don't be afraid of saying you but make it not about like you are it's more about like this is what you did. And yeah, I actually I heard about that in a Danish parenting book as well, where they focus on like a growth mindset of not like you are this but like you did this and behavior can be be learned.

Ali  33:08  
That's a really good one. Now that's a great one.

Unknown Speaker  33:11  
That's a great one.

Emma  33:12  
Also give positive feedback. Sorry, that was my last Yes,

Ali  33:15  
yeah. And Assisi people's managers, when you give the positive feedback,

Sidney  33:19  
yes. Please give positive feedback. That's the only way that you're gonna be able to like, establish like, oh, okay, like, imposter syndrome is rare. And people like, come on. Sometimes you just like, you don't know. And I think that we've all experienced that, where it's just like, Am I like doing? Am I

Unknown Speaker  33:35  
doing okay, like, is

Sidney  33:36  
this something that like, I can truly say, and just sometimes, I need that I need that like external like confirmation? Not always but like, yeah, just especially when you're starting out?

Ali  33:47  
Um,

Sidney  33:48  
what else can we talk about? I think that this other thing is really important is like to remember to confirm your payroll, make sure you remember what retirement options that you might have, do your research on that make sure that you are correct in whatever accounts that you're What is it getting paid to like? Yeah, director, I don't know why that word escaped me.

Kelly  34:18  
I lived this life as a as the employer. So yeah, definitely. I mean, you should already know what types of benefits you're getting since he did sign the the job offer, and you didn't sign the employment agreements. But take advantage of these not every especially if your company has a 401k in the United States. That does not automatically OPT you in make sure you opt yourself in if you want to take advantage of that. If your company offers some kind of match, like let's say a 4% match. That's free money. Do it.

Ali  34:54  
Yeah. And insurance to sorry, Emma

Emma  34:58  
go for I was just gonna say I didn't set Direct Deposit when I first got to Sweden, and so I had to go like two months without a paycheck. And I had to like wire money for my us account. And sometimes my car didn't work. It was the most stressful situation ever. So I set up direct deposit on day one.

Kelly  35:14  
Yes,

Emma  35:15  
yeah. Especially cuz we only get paid once a month here. So I had to wait a lot longer, right? Oh, my God.

Kelly  35:21  
Also shout out to gusto. We use gusto for our payroll solution. They make the onboarding process for new employees. so incredibly easy. They are not paying me to say this. I am just a huge gusto fan.

Emma  35:33  
Hashtag not sponsored, it's really good.

Unknown Speaker  35:37  
Get them to sponsor and that would be nice gusto. If

Kelly  35:40  
you're listening,

Emma  35:42  
hit me up. You know, I think this topic of conversation really revolves around making sure you know what your benefits are and utilizing them. So me like if when I joined Spotify, they had a lot of sessions about benefits, like a lot of benefit conversations they offer here are things I didn't know about. They offer like in vitro fertilization to couples in the us up to a certain threshold, they offer egg freezing for women who are not ready to have children yet, but want you someday, like these are all benefits that I wouldn't necessarily have known about if I didn't attend the session. So if you have them, do them,

Kelly  36:15  
if they don't make sure you've read the company's Handbook, I know it does not sound like a fun read. Read the handbook is very helpful. Also, some of us pay an attorney a lot of money to draft a handbook. So get my put the money to, you know, to good use. Yeah,

Ali  36:31  
I think Yeah. And if you have a if you work for a big company, and they give you like a checklist of things to do actually go through that checklist of things to do. Yeah, I think Emma and I both had this experience recently with AWS and her wife, Spotify, where AWS gave me this massive checklist of things to do. And it felt intimidating. At first, they kind of did space it up, though. So it was an email drip of one week, I got one checklist. And the second week, I got a second checklist. And it kind of grew over time, I guess, but that had all the information about setting up 401k is setting up insurance setting up. Again, the benefits she was talking about with reproduction and all that as well. So definitely check all that out. Do the checklist if you're given one.

Unknown Speaker  37:19  
Nice.

Sidney  37:20  
I really like that you guys had a Trello checklist Am I like that's First off, I live off of Trello and some people will like probably hunt me down and murder me if I say that, but I love Trello I

Emma  37:33  
think it's the best class manager to to it's

Sidney  37:35  
just it's really nice to be able to just like swipe just brush this away. I don't need this anymore by and it just, I don't know, that's instant, like feedback and just like instant niceness to me. I feel like Giuliana says and take advantage of the other benefits like health stuff. Oh, massages, language learning Pluralsight accounts discounts? Yes, definitely. I do you guys like Pluralsight I, I this is a hot take. I don't like Pluralsight I think it's

Emma  38:03  
dense for me. But take advantage of any learning like we use LinkedIn learning. And if you don't have it as an option, always ask ask your manager Hey, can I get a subscription? Because Yeah, in the past, I've never had an employer say no,

Ali  38:16  
yeah, we have a cloud guru at work, which is like the perfect fit. And I've learned so much from there about my job. So highly recommend. Yeah, I

Kelly  38:28  
definitely want to stress the piece about asking your employer or your boss or whoever about getting access to certain things. The reason why every every developer on my team as a front end masters account now it's because somebody asked

Emma  38:40  
Also, if you're moving to a foreign country asked about language classes. In Germany, it was it was offered internally, but I was not allowed to attend but they reimburse me they cover the cost of like an external like school. Also in Sweden, they offer it so it's also make sure you ask if your partner is allowed to take these things as well, because Spotify allows they have many benefits for partners. But let's talk quickly about like, appointments and vacation because I this is one thing I always make sure to do. If I join a new company is immediately put if I know I have time off that I need to take I'll tell my manager first. And then I'll schedule it in workday or whatever scheduling tool we have. Because it's really important to get that on the calendar.

Sidney  39:25  
That's good to know. I'm seeming is that like I had? Just so I guess you guys are aware I'm going to be moving soon. So I'm still kind of like, should I be like doing that? Like Should I just be like Hey, like I'll need a week off just to go like searching for places like I need a house to live in. Dammit. So that that makes me feel a little bit better talking about than just being like just, I'm gonna put it down just that's our that's what's gonna happen. I'm

Kelly  39:53  
very excited.

Sidney  39:56  
We're gonna finally be in the same state guys.

Ali  40:01  
Everybody's super excited about

Emma  40:02  
it. So yes, I'm ready. I'm ready. We're gonna do a European road show. That was my question. Hello, vaccinate. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  40:10  
I don't know if what is that a roadshow?

Kelly  40:12  
Like literally go to Europe? And yeah, horror podcasts and

Unknown Speaker  40:17  
talking about

Sidney  40:20  
that makes sense. That would be really cool. We should try and plan that in the next couple of years. I'm trying to go to Japan finally after like, my ticket, and everything got canceled from the Olympics. So Oh, yeah.

I'm just saying, I like I'm looking for a trip. So when are we going? What are we doing this? Do I need to look it on my calendar? Now? I guess

Kelly  40:39  
all this to say, just make sure you use your vacation like it is it is there for a reason. And it is supposed to be used. So please, please take time off.

Unknown Speaker  40:50  
You've earned it. You've earned it.

Kelly  40:53  
by insisting at the company, you've earned it just by existing

Sidney  40:56  
Yes. Okay, so then I think that we've talked a little bit about this, but I want to kind of like hit it home, when it comes to training and getting used to your working environment. We've already told you guys that you really do need to take advantage of making sure that you ask about different types of subscriptions, classes, language learning different kinds of benefits that you might be able to take advantage of just because you ask your manager or some person in the hierarchy, but I'm making sure that in kind of like the local space, getting used to your work environment is going to be incredibly important for you guys. So make sure that you have um, what is that documents like from your manager, give them to your manager, if there is like a certain way that you like to work best when it comes to your one on ones, your meetings. Um, I particularly like to have a developer journal, that is something really important to me to help list out my different sets of training, it's helped me when it comes to like referencing some other notes that I've made that are really important, but aren't necessarily in the documentation. And it's just kind of like knowledge that people have like inside of their heads that live there. And maybe that will help you in the long run potentially updates the documentation. But also, this is a place where you can share your accomplishments, you can reflect on the wins that you've had, you can reflect on lessons, or find a way to help you get unstuck and just like brain dump. So making sure that that is something that you guys have, I have a YouTube video on that. So we'll link that in the show notes. But also, I feel like when it comes to also working with the environment, and being able to let's just say that you're a developer getting access as early as you can, to the work environment and the code environment that you're in, it's not like you're going to be pushing anything into production, you just want to experiment inside of like the local environment, the test environment, and just like see what exactly you can kind of connect the dots on to help you figure out like what exactly you're going to be doing for the tasks ahead. What do you guys think about that?

Emma  43:06  
Yeah, I love that. And in terms of documentation, and getting the codebase up and running. One of the things that Spotify did that I think every company should do is have an internal tutorial on how to create an app with all of their technologies, Oh, my God. So we use backstage, which is an open source piece of software for internal documentation, highly recommend it, I think it's wonderful. They had this, this tutorial, they had them for all different parts of the stack. If you were like a data analyst or a back end engineer, it was called the Golden path. And essentially, it walks you through step by step how to create your Spotify application and use the API's and all of that. That was insanely useful. But the first couple of minutes of my manager, first of all, I met with him every single day, for the first two weeks to make sure I was feeling good, especially remotely. We had a career path conversation where both of us we had a timeline, and we went through our entire career paths. And then we plotted when we were excited about what we were working on and when we were low energy with it. And so we had a chart both of us, which I loved. And then the second exercise we did was a motivation exercise. And I had a bunch of different cards. It was like money, feeling accepted by my co workers, the ability to be autonomous on my team. And you plot those along a scale from like a biggest motivation to smallest motivation. And that way your manager can tell what motivates you. And then lastly, we have this thing called okrs and stands for objectives and key results. And that's where I track not only my personal goals, but my progress on this goal. So make sure you're tracking your small wins

Ali  44:34  
big also have it Yeah, I think having documentation that you pass from manager to manager is a really great idea of all the things that make you tick so that motivations like Emma was saying what your career goals are, but then also your wins. How you work best, what are things that really bother you or really get you fired up? What are the things that yeah, exactly what are the things that make you unique as a worker because Even if you stick out this job for 10 years, most likely, you're gonna have a bunch of different managers over that time. And so having documentation that you can pass from manager to manager, and so it doesn't hold back your career when you change managers think that's a really great thing to have. I also have a note repository, and then a wins repository where I have those both private on my GitHub, the notes are on everything that I could think of just because there's so much to remember, it's like my second brain, I use Rome research, which is an open source, kind of clone of foam research, I think, or Rome research is the closest one. And then foam is the open source one, I think I use phone. So I really, really highly recommend having those notes that you build up over time. And I like GitHub, just because I live there as a developer as is, I would also say, from a management perspective, have a quick wins, that you can set up for that person. So give them a couple of issues that will allow them to navigate your code base, but will be a pretty quick for them, at least hopefully to finish and complete and make it so that they feel accomplished early on.

Sidney  46:12  
That makes sense. That makes sense. I have a question here that I'd like to address Caitlin Floyd had asked when you're starting a new job, how much learning should be on the clock? And how much should be off the clock?

Unknown Speaker  46:24  
I think that depends very

Kelly  46:26  
much on the company. I don't expect you to do any additional like if I hire you to build Shopify stores and you don't know Shopify yet, I'm not going to expect you to work overtime, on your own time to learn Shopify, I'm literally paying you to learn that

Sidney  46:40  
I think that I had the expectation where I was supposed to be learning always off the clock. And in some ways that left me very burnt out and very stressed and very demotivated about the different projects that I was on at one time. And so when I stopped doing that, I felt much more like appreciative of like the resources that I was given to do everything on the clock, like at certain times, because I don't know, maybe sometimes it's not like appropriate to like be sitting down and like learning things. And you're supposed to actually execute. But I think that also just like depends on like the like structure of the company and like how like strict that is, I don't know, I have different kind of takes on that. But what do you guys think I'm an alley,

Ali  47:23  
I think there's a huge benefit to as you need to know learning. So don't necessarily spend hours and hours and hours on the workday, learning all the things you could possibly know about any topic that you don't really need to know that much about it. But learning the things that you're going to need to do to get x ticket resolved or whatever that is completely within the scope of what you should be doing during the day. I also think that employers that have a block of time each week for you to learn is an awesome benefit to have. And so I think most of the learning should be during the work day. That being said, if it's something that's a little bit tangential, then maybe that is done during a different time. Yeah,

Emma  48:05  
we do these hack. We call them hack weeks, where every month, I think they give us a week to literally hack on whatever we want, we can build something or we can learn something. And if you learn anything substantial, you're welcome to talk about it. But yeah, it's just honestly, I don't think anyone at Spotify would ever look down on you for being like, you know, I'm gonna take today and just learn. And I love being in that type of environment. And I encourage any employer listening to adopt that as well, because it's going to pay off so long as it relates back to your day job. It's in some way, right? Like, I'm not gonna go learn Swahili on the clock. But

Ali  48:39  
I think one other thing that we should mention is that you're only going to be new once. And so while you're new, ask all the questions that you have, because you have the total excuse of not knowing anything at this point. And so get comfortable asking questions at this point. And there's no such thing really as a dumb question. So make sure to ask all those things. Make relationships with the people that will be able to answer your questions and that you want to learn from during the work day.

Sidney  49:12  
And for anybody that's listening. That's a more experienced developer that's potentially teaching other people especially like new recruits, or new developers, please stop saying that shit is easy. Because depending on like the scope of whatever you're doing, it might be like easy for you because you've done it for years. That doesn't mean that it's going to be super easy or super like obtainable to that person that is first off overwhelmed when it comes to their new job and second off, like maybe has not never like seen anything like that before or has not used any of that knowledge to the specific extent that you are saying that it is easy, so stop saying that shit, it needs to be out of your vocabulary period.

Ali  49:52  
Awesome. I have one question from our audience that I want to address. So as a junior software engineer, what kinds of targets goals should you be? setting for yourself in the first few months of joining the company, I think this is going to really depend on your company. And so I would talk to your managers and mentors and see what they suggest as a reasonable goal, because it's going to be very different at different places. But I think starting to get comfortable with the codebase is the most important thing that you can do early on that you can navigate it faster and faster in the future.

Kelly  50:23  
Exactly. And those first few months, you're really spending time familiarizing yourself with the company, the processes codebase, as you mentioned, it's I would never expect somebody to you know, overextend themselves and especially as a as a junior, like your goal as a junior is to learn. At least it should be. They even told me

Ali  50:45  
they wanted AWS like, We don't expect you to be up to speed until six months in. We don't expect you to be at that point until it till then. And so having those expectations set upfront, I think is really helpful that you don't have to know everything day one, you don't have to be fully up to speed. You have a certain amount of time in order to get yourself there. Absolutely.

Sidney  51:06  
That's a great take. Thank you. Thank you, Tammy for asking that question. We really appreciate it. Um,

Unknown Speaker  51:12  
what's next?

Kelly  51:13  
What else should we talk? We should should shift into shout outs now. Yeah, let's

Unknown Speaker  51:18  
do it. Kelly, you go first. All

Kelly  51:19  
right, I'm going to be that person. My peloton finally arrived. So I'm going to talk about my peloton all the time, I absolutely love it. I decided to get the bike plus instead of the bike and being able to rotate the screen and do the auto follow stuff is the coolest thing. And also, I'm a really, really competitive person. So finally getting access to the leaderboard is very inspiring for me, so I am happy that after 12 weeks my peloton finally arrived.

Sidney  51:46  
Oh, congratulations. That sounds great. How about you, Emma,

Emma  51:50  
I'm gonna do some self promo because why the hell not. We finally released the new edition of my book about the technical interview process. Super excited about it, because it's been a year since I first released it. So very excited and shout out to the team. Joel hooks, and the team who helped me get this off the ground.

Sidney  52:08  
granulations is a really great book. So you guys should check it out. I'm like slowly going through it myself. So y'all, it has been Ladybug podcast approved. So yeah, so I don't know if that like is bias, but whatever.

Emma  52:24  
It's like Stack Overflow recursion. Proving our own stuff. Cool. Something like

Ali  52:33  
what about you? Nine is the calm app, which is this meditation app. on my phone. I've been really enjoying that. I was like somebody who was like, I could not do meditation. I'm just too wired up and anxious. But I've been doing it recently and it's been nice. So highly recommend. Sydney have a young,

Sidney  52:54  
I have a couple of like very small things. So I'm just gonna like list them out. today. First off, thank you guys so much for like having me as a co host here. Like it's been really fun. Definitely was not expecting me to like hit me up and be like, hey, just I loved your talk after like, me and Allie, like had you on the show? Like forget, let's just do it. Let's just like have you as a co host. So I appreciate it all the love. It's been a wild, right, honestly. And yeah, we're gonna like slowly get all these YouTube videos up. So just stay patient with us guys. The second thing is that I realized that some of my launchcode students actually listened to the ladybug podcast and didn't realize that I was a co host. So shout out to you guys. Hi, you see my face now so haha. Alright, it's good to see you every Wednesday. Um, and then next, all of just everybody that has been really supportive of me. It's been like a really strange and like stressful past couple of months. So you guys will hear about it later. It's totally fine. I'm not dying. But I just appreciate everybody that's been very supportive of me and everything. So yes, I have love and happiness and shout outs and thank yous to everybody. That's and we love you.

Kelly  54:01  
And we're so glad that you make the ladybug podcast, so. Oh, thanks.

Unknown Speaker  54:08  
I appreciate it.

Unknown Speaker  54:09  
Oh, yeah. So

Sidney  54:09  
that is it. That's it for our live show. And if you liked this episode, make sure that you go on ahead and tweet about it. And because you have tweeted about it, we will select one tweeter to win a copy of Miss Emma's that free book. This week, we're gonna give a free copy. So just make sure that you guys tweet about it. It's not free actually. But we are going to be sending out a free copy. I don't know why I said that. But anyways, this is our last episode of the season. Like I think that I went predict successfully ladies. So I think it did it by we will be seeing you guys in a couple of months for season six. And I will have more resources in the show notes and thanks. And that's it. We love you guys. Thanks so much. And this is the ladybug podcast. Thanks for watching.
